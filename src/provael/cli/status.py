    One place computes these so every other surface can render rather than retype — the README,
    the docs, the Space and the website all restate them, and a restated number drifts.

    It never prints a bare total. `families=16` alone reads as sixteen MEASURED families; the
    `real_policy` / `stub_only` pair is what stops that, and it travels in the same output so a
    consumer cannot pick up only the flattering half. Note also that `attacks` and `families` are
    different numbers: 39 adversarial attacks group into 17 adversarial families, and reading the
    registry dict's length as a family count overstates coverage by 14.

    From a pip-installed wheel the evidence fields read `unscanned` rather than `0`. A wheel does
    not package `results/`, so there is nothing to derive them from — and `real_policy=0` would
    read as "no family has ever been measured", contradicting a published claim rather than
    reporting a local fact. Registry counts are properties of the package, correct either way.
