    the install is not the problem — the SECOND run is, when someone reaches for `--policy smolvla`
    without the `[lerobot]` extra, or for the keep-out suite without a calibration, and gets an
    import error or a silent default instead of a diagnosis.

    Everything here is read locally except the PyPI version, which `--offline` skips. Nothing is
    inferred: a backend is reported as importable only after actually importing it, and the
    calibration and freshness rows read the same constants the runtime does.
