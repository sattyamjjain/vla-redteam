    machinery has existed since the board did and has never been exercised by an outsider, which
    is the kind of thing a five-step README causes.

    every step prints the command it ran so a submitter can do it by hand instead. If `gh` is
    missing or unauthenticated the command still validates and signs, then prints the exact
    remaining steps rather than failing at the end with the work thrown away.
