    """Emit an Embodied AI Security Top 10 taxonomy crosswalk (deterministic).

    ``--target robojailbench`` maps RoboJailBench's 18 harm categories to the EAI id(s) and provael
    attack family/families that cover them, with an honest coverage state per category. Sim-only;
    no RoboJailBench benchmark is run and no comparative scores are produced.

    ``--target atlas`` maps all ten EAI risks to MITRE ATLAS tactic → technique phrasing, each with
    its coverage state. Proposed mapping, not endorsed by MITRE, and deliberately free of
    ``AML.TXXXX`` ids.

    ``--target foresight`` maps ForesightSafety-VLA's 13 diagnostic categories (arXiv:2606.27079),
    quoted verbatim, and states plainly where that benchmark's headline finding DISAGREES with
    provael's one real measurement. With ``--in`` it also reports this run's cumulative cost, risk
    exposure time and unsafe success rate — in their vocabulary, in provael's units, with the
    incomparability warning attached.

    ``--target vla_arena`` maps VLA-Arena's five safety suites (arXiv:2512.22539), identifiers
    verbatim, and carries the fact that their safety axis is **non-adversarial** as a
    machine-readable field: their suites place a hazard in the scene, none perturbs the instruction,
    so the corresponding provael arm is the benign control rather than any attack family.

    ``--target safevla`` maps SafeVLA-Bench (arXiv:2606.00773) structurally and records why no
    numeric comparison is emitted — provael's ``succ_but_unsafe`` shares a name with their SBU and
    has not been shown to share units, on an uncalibrated predicate.

    Neither ``vla_arena`` nor ``safevla`` accepts a measured comparison, so ``--in`` has no effect
    on them. That is a property of the mapping, not a missing feature.
