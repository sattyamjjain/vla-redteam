    This is the INPUT to a keep-out calibration (#136) and deliberately not the calibration. A
    calibrated zone needs a margin - how far outside the benign envelope the hazard region starts -
    and choosing one before looking at real benign spread is exactly how the current default box
    came to overlap the workspace it was meant to sit outside. So this prints the observation and
    stops.

    The episode count per task is part of the answer, not a footnote: bounds from two episodes and
    bounds from fifty are different objects, and a thin estimate is flagged rather than smoothed.
