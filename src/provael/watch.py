"""Continuous-measurement watch: a freshness signal that decays on its own.

A point-in-time scan and a continuously-verified claim are different products, and only the second
one is referenceable — a standards body citing "Provael measured X" needs to know whether X was
measured last night or last quarter. The repo already had the raw material (an append-only trial
ledger, a per-checkpoint regression differ) and no way to answer "how old is the newest number?"
without reading JSON by hand. The published board sat a month stale and nothing surfaced it.

WHY THE BADGE COLOUR IS COMPUTED AT REFRESH TIME, NOT AT MEASUREMENT TIME. The obvious design —
have the nightly measurement emit a green badge — fails in exactly the case the badge exists for:
if the nightly dies, nothing regenerates the file, and the badge stays frozen on the last green it
ever wrote. A freshness indicator that cannot go stale-red is worse than none, because it
actively asserts currency it is not checking.

So the age is recomputed on every refresh from the *recorded measurement time*, and the refresh is
a cheap CPU job that runs on its own schedule, independent of whether any measurement happened
(``.github/workflows/freshness.yml``). The badge therefore reddens by itself the moment
measurements stop — which is the only behaviour that makes it worth putting in a README.

The thresholds are days, not runs: "7 releases behind" stopped meaning anything when the release
cadence went daily, and the same trap applies here.
