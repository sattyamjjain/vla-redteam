"""``provael`` command-line interface.

Commands:
  * ``attack``         — run a red-team evaluation and write a report.
  * ``list-policies``  — show registered policies, whether they're runnable here, and whether a
    real checkpoint has ever been run through them (measured vs. scaffolding).
  * ``list-suites``    — show registered suites, marking CPU fixtures apart from real simulators.
  * ``list-attacks``   — show registered attacks and families.
  * ``report``         — print a previously written report.
  * ``transfer-test``  — per-family rate + 95% Wilson CI + benign control + transfer-status.
  * ``version``        — print the tool version.

Errors that a user can act on (missing ``[lerobot]`` extra, unknown policy / suite /
attack, bad config) are caught and printed as a single clear line with a non-zero
exit code — never a raw traceback.
