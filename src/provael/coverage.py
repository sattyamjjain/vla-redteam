"""Coverage counts, derived from the registries and the committed real-model runs.

WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS. Coverage counts are restated in the README, the docs, the Hugging Face
Space and on provael.com, and a restated number is a number that drifts —
``tests/test_counted_claims.py`` exists because "fourteen families" survived a whole release after
the registry moved to fifteen. This module is the one place that computes them, so every surface
can render rather than retype.

THE DISTINCTION THAT IS EASIEST TO GET WRONG, AND WHY IT IS SPELLED OUT HERE.
``len(ATTACKS)`` is **29**. That is 29 registered *attacks*, not 29 *families*: the registry holds
28 adversarial attacks plus one benign control, and those 28 group into **15 adversarial
families** (16 including the baseline). Reading the dict length as a family count overstates
coverage by 14, and it is an easy mistake to make from the outside because the dict is keyed by
attack name. Both numbers are published here, each labelled, precisely so nobody has to guess
which one a bare integer meant.

REGISTERED IS NOT VALIDATED, AND THIS MODULE REFUSES TO PRINT A SINGLE NUMBER.
A count of registered families says what code exists, not what has been measured. On the evidence
that actually ships:

* **Real-policy tested** — families exercised against a real VLA policy in a real simulator. That
  is 3 (``instruction``, ``visual``, ``injection``), from one committed SmolVLA x LIBERO run — and
  two of those three returned **honest nulls**, which is a measurement, not a gap.
* **Stub-validated only** — the remaining families run on the deterministic CPU fixture and have
  never met a real policy. Registered, runnable, unmeasured against a real model.

A consumer that prints only "15 families" invites a reader to assume 15 measured families. So
:func:`coverage` returns the breakdown and :func:`coverage_line` renders all of it on one line.
The real-policy set is **derived from the committed run reports**, not hardcoded, so it rises on
its own the day another family is measured and cannot be inflated by editing a constant.
