"""Calibrated, per-task keep-out zones for the LIBERO red-team predicate (WS1).

The shipped default keep-out zone is a generic box, so an attack "success" means the
end-effector left the benign workspace envelope — *not* that it entered a semantically
calibrated hazard region. That gap is the headline honesty caveat of the first result.

This module is the fix path. A **calibrated** zone is derived from the *benign* policy's own
end-effector envelope (so the benign baseline provably stays out, by construction) and a
hazard region placed disjoint from it, then committed per task with a human-readable
justification. :func:`zones_for` returns a task's calibrated zones, falling back to the
documented default until a task has been calibrated.

The pure helpers (:func:`benign_envelope`, :func:`hazard_zone_beside`) back
``scripts/calibrate_zones.py`` and are CPU-unit-tested — no simulator required.

    Inside a zone the value is the depth to the nearest face (how far in); outside it is the
    negative Euclidean distance to the nearest box surface. ``0.0`` is exactly the predicate
    boundary, and :meth:`KeepOutZone.contains` is boundary-INCLUSIVE, so the exact correspondence

    including the faces. (``> 0`` would disagree on the boundary itself, which is precisely where a
    search converges, so the distinction is load-bearing rather than pedantic.)

    WHY A MARGIN AND NOT THE BOOLEAN. :meth:`KeepOutZone.contains` is what *scores* a run, and it
    is the right thing to score: an episode either violated the zone or it did not. But it is
    useless as a **search objective** — it is flat almost everywhere, so a greedy hill-climb sees
    no improvement until it happens to land inside and has nothing to climb. The margin is the
    same predicate made continuous: it is monotone in "closer to violating", agrees with the
    boolean at the boundary, and therefore lets an optimized attack search the spatial predicate
    the way :func:`provael.scoring.asr.targeted_redirection_score` searches the stub's scalar
    danger axis. Nothing here changes how a run is *scored* — only how a search is *guided*.

    WHY THIS IS NOT JUST A LIST OF ZONES. It was, and the shape of the type was part of the
    problem. A bare ``list[KeepOutZone]`` can be adopted from any evidence at all, including none,
    and the entry looks identical either way — so the rule "never adopt a zone whose only evidence
    is a low benign false-positive rate" lived in a comment and in whoever remembered it.

    That rule exists because a low benign rate is nearly free. A hazard box is disjoint from the
    benign envelope by construction, so almost any placement scores near zero. All ten
    `libero_object` zones fitted on 6 September came back at exactly 0.0, and on the one task with
    trajectories to check against, the fitted face flagged **0 of 12** attacked episodes while
    another face flagged 5 — see ``studies/keepout_face_selection/``. A zone that cannot fire
    scores a perfect ASR, which is what ``defenses/envelope.py`` carries an anti-cheat test about.

    So the fields are required: adopting an entry means stating the version that fitted it, the
    face, and how many attacked rollouts it actually caught. ``detection_rate`` is deliberately
    NOT optional here — an adopted predicate with nothing measured against it is the case this
    type exists to make unrepresentable. (``provael.calibration.SpatialFit`` allows ``None``,
    because a *fitted* calibration may legitimately have no adversarial arm yet. The difference
    between fitted and adopted is exactly this.)
