"""Standards-aligned assurance profiles over a :class:`~provael.types.RunReport` (sim-only).

``provael attest --profile <iso-10218-2|iec-62443|insurer>`` embeds one of these views inside the
signed attestation. Each maps the **same** measured ASR + EAI-Top-10 findings + per-family
transfer-test results onto a standards framing — reusing :mod:`provael.scoring`,
:mod:`provael.compliance`, and the insurer report (:mod:`provael.hosted.report`); **nothing is
re-measured, re-scored, or re-signed**. Every view carries the honest per-family transfer caveat
(a stub-only family is never presented as a real-model result) and the evidence-not-certification
disclaimer.

**Not a conformity assessment.** This is red-team *evidence* that feeds a cyber-risk assessment,
an insurer's underwriting, or a third-party safety-certification process. Provael is an independent
project and is **not** affiliated with, endorsed by, or a certification body for ISO, IEC, the EU,
NIST, NVIDIA, UL, or any organisation named below. The Embodied AI Security Top 10 is Provael's
own list (never "OWASP"). No "first" claim is made.
