"""Adoption is loaded from packaged artifacts, gated on evidence, and never silently drops one.

WHAT THIS STOPS. `CALIBRATED_ZONES` was a hand-written literal that stayed `{}` while ten fitted
calibrations sat committed under `results/calibration/`, and nothing connected the two: the dict
could stay empty forever and every check would pass. Issue #136 has been open since 16 August on
exactly that gap.

THE INVARIANT ASSERTED HERE IS NOT "artifacts exist, therefore adopt". That version of the test
would force adoption of a predicate measured to catch nothing — five of the six candidate hazard
faces score a 0.0 benign false-positive rate and flag zero attacked episodes
(`studies/keepout_face_selection/`), so a low benign rate is not evidence a boundary works, and a
zone that cannot fire scores a perfect ASR. The invariant is that every committed fit is
ACCOUNTED FOR: adopted, or withheld with a stated reason. Silence is the failure; refusal is not.

WHY THE PACKAGED DIRECTORY AND NOT `results/`. `pyproject.toml` ships `packages = ["src/provael"]`,
so `results/` is absent from a wheel entirely. Loading the predicate from there would make the
boundary every ASR is scored against differ between a source checkout and a `pip install` — the
same published number resting on two different predicates depending on how the reader installed
the tool. This repository already learned that in 0.26.0 (`suites/__init__.py`: a probe of
`results/` "answers differently in a checkout and in a wheel, and it fails toward *measured*").
`test_adoption_does_not_depend_on_an_unpackaged_directory` is the guard against repeating it.
