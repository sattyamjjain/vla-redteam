"""The registered/runnable split must stay tied to the declarations it is derived from.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `watch/registry.json` published `policies` and `suites` as bare integers, and the
code has always known better: `SCAFFOLDING_POLICIES` and `SCAFFOLDING_SUITES` declare which entries
are registered but have never been run, and `list-policies` / `list-suites` already render that.
`coverage_json()` did not export it, so a consumer wanting the runnable number had nowhere to read
it and typed one instead. www.provael.com published "5 suites" beside a registry saying 6 — the
same drift the artifact was built to end, one convention over.

WHAT IS ASSERTED, and each of these is a way the split could rot quietly:

1. The parts sum to the whole, for policies and for suites. A scaffolding entry removed from the
   dict but left in the artifact, or vice versa, breaks the arithmetic before it reaches a reader.
2. The exported NAME lists equal the source dicts exactly. Counts that agree while the names have
   drifted is the worse failure, because a consumer rendering "which ones" would be wrong while
   every total still added up.
3. The committed artifact agrees with a fresh computation. `make gen-registry` is the only way
   this file should ever change.
4. Nothing is derived by probing the filesystem. `SCAFFOLDING_SUITES` records why: `docs/` and
   `results/` are not packaged, so a probe answers differently in a checkout and in a wheel, and
   it fails toward "measured". A wheel must report the same split as a source tree.
