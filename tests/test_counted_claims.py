"""One guard for every prose claim that restates a number derived from the registry.

THE DRIFT THIS EXISTS TO STOP. `universal_patch` was registered in 0.29.0, taking the registry
from fourteen adversarial families to fifteen. The CHANGELOG entry for that very release said
"15 adversarial families (was 14)" — and `README.md`, `SAFETY.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` went on
saying **fourteen** for a whole release, because nothing imports prose and so nothing noticed.
`tests/test_recipes.py` already asserts that `full-sweep` covers every registry family; what it
could not see is that the documentation describing that sweep had fallen a family behind.

A counted claim is the cheapest thing in this repo to get wrong and one of the more expensive to
be caught getting wrong: the product's entire pitch is that its numbers are checkable, so a
reader who counts `provael list-attacks` and gets a different answer from the README has found a
reason to distrust every other number on the page. This guard is the same discipline as the
SHA-pinned workflows and `test_version_consistency.py` — the count has a single source (the
registry), and every restatement of it is checked against that source rather than trusted.

TWO CHECKS, BECAUSE THEY FAIL DIFFERENTLY.

1. **The enumerated claims** (`_CLAIMS`) pin an exact sentence in an exact file. If the number is
   stale it fails with both numbers; if the sentence was *reworded* the pattern stops matching and
   it fails too — a guard that silently matches nothing is the failure mode this repo has already
   been bitten by twice (the vacuous dependency audit, the pin scan that found no pins).
2. **The sweep** (`test_no_stale_family_count_anywhere`) re-reads every adopter-facing document
   for the phrase regardless of whether anyone remembered to enumerate it here. An allow-list only
   guards what someone thought to add to it, which is exactly what a new stale claim will not be.

WHY SOME FILES ARE EXEMPT. A count is not stale when it is *historical*. `CHANGELOG.md` describes
each release as it shipped; `docs/studies/action-envelope.md` reports a study measured on 0.28.0
over the fourteen families that existed then, and rewriting it to fifteen would attribute a
measurement to a registry that did not produce it. Those are records, not claims about today.

# the `list-attacks` sweep — the shape that got past both checks above
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

#: WHY A SECOND SWEEP. `README.md` said "28 attacks across …" for two releases while
#: `docs/quickstart.md` — the identical claim one directory away — was corrected in 0.29.1. Neither
#: check above could see it. The enumerated list named only quickstart, and
#: :data:`_SWEEP` keys on the noun phrase "adversarial families", which that README line never
#: used: it wrote the count against an *enumerated family list* inside a shell comment in a fenced
#: code block. Nothing about being in a code fence hid it — the sweep reads whole files — the
#: phrasing simply fell outside the only pattern being looked for.
#:
#: WHY THIS ANCHOR AND NOT A BROADER ONE. Sweeping every "N attacks" or "N families" in the tree
#: is the obvious generalisation and it is wrong: most such phrases are true statements about a
#: *subset*, not restatements of the registry. `attacks/action.py` says "Two attacks" of its own
#: family, `recipes.py` says "nine attacks across four families" of the `quick` preset, and the
#: crosswalk says "three families" of a mapping. A guard that failed on those would be reverted
#: within a week, which is worse than no guard.
#:
#: `provael list-attacks` is the anchor that carries the meaning, because
#: :func:`provael.cli.list_attacks` iterates :data:`~provael.attacks.registry.ATTACKS` and prints
#: every family — so a count offered as *what that command shows* is a claim about the whole
#: registry, always, with no subset reading available. That is exactly the claim that was wrong in
#: `README.md`, and it was wrong a second time in `notebooks/01_provael_in_5_minutes.ipynb`, which
#: annotated `list-attacks` with the `quick` recipe's nine-attacks-four-families figure.

# the enumerations — the shape that got past every check above
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

#: WHY A THIRD CLASS OF CHECK. Everything above guards a NUMBER. On 4 September 2026 every number
#: in this repo was right and three documents were still wrong, because what had drifted was the
#: LIST beside the number:
#:
#: * ``README.md`` annotated ``provael list-attacks`` with "42 attacks across 19 families:" and
#:   then enumerated **eighteen** of them. ``control`` had been missing since it was registered.
#:   :data:`_LIST_ATTACKS_COUNT` matched that very line, read "42" and "19", found both correct,
#:   and passed — it was never looking at the names.
#: * ``docs/quickstart.md`` said "19 families (17 adversarial + the benign baseline)". Both numbers
#:   correct; 17 + 1 = 18.
#: * ``README.md`` and ``docs/quickstart.md`` both said **5 suites** and enumerated the same five,
#:   while ``keepout_zones``… in fact while ``ai2_bridge`` had been registered as a sixth. The
#:   published ``watch/registry.json`` said 6 the whole time, so the artifact and the prose
#:   contradicted each other in public.
#:
#: A count and its enumeration are the same claim made twice. Guarding one of them is guarding
#: half a claim.
_FAMILY_TOKEN = r"[a-z][a-z0-9_]{2,}"  # noqa: S105 - a regex for family names, not a secret

#: A run of family names joined by ``/``. Five is the threshold and it is chosen, not arbitrary:
#: the largest legitimate PARTIAL enumeration in this repo is ``CORE_FAMILIES`` at four
#: (``recipes.py`` renders "nine attacks across four families"), so five or more slash-joined
#: registry names is a list that means to be complete. A lower threshold would flag real subsets
#: and the guard would be reverted inside a week, which is worse than no guard.
