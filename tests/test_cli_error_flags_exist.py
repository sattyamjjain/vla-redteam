"""No command may advise a flag it does not define.

WHY THIS EXISTS. ``provael submit`` signs unconditionally and defines no ``--no-sign``, but the
shared ``MissingAttestExtraError`` it echoed ends "(or pass --no-sign for a digest-only bundle)" —
correct advice for ``attest``, impossible for ``submit``. A user without the ``attest`` extra was
told to reach for a flag that does not exist, on the one command whose failure blocks a
contribution. The message was right about the extra and wrong about the escape hatch, which is the
worse half to get wrong: the extra is discoverable, the missing flag sends you reading ``--help``
for something that was never there.

This walks the real Typer app rather than grepping source, so a command that gains an error string
mentioning a flag it lacks fails here even if the string is built at runtime.
