"""`watch/release.json` must never disagree with the package it describes.

WHY THIS GUARD IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE ARTIFACT. The file exists so a consumer derives the
release instead of keeping a copy, and a copy that drifts is exactly the defect it replaces: on
6 September 2026, 14 built pages of www.provael.com rendered v0.39.3 while the tag, the GitHub
release and PyPI all said 0.39.4. An artifact published for consumption that can itself go stale
would move the same bug one hop rather than fix it.

So the assertion is deliberately narrow and total: every value in the file derives from
`provael.__version__`, and the committed bytes must equal a fresh render.
