"""`provael --help` is a published surface, and a refactor must not move it.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Issue #193 asks for `src/provael/cli.py` — three thousand lines and 27 top-level
commands — to be split into modules, and states the acceptance plainly: every `--help` must render
identically before and after, because adopters have pinned these commands and flags in their own
scripts. That acceptance cannot be checked by reading a two-thousand-line file move.

`scripts/gen_cli_surface.py` captures the surface as data — command order, help text, parameter
names, flags, required-ness — and `tests/fixtures/cli-surface.json` is the committed snapshot. The
snapshot is data rather than rendered `--help` text because rendered help wraps to the terminal: a
byte-comparison of it fails on a different `COLUMNS` and passes on a genuinely lost option that
happened to reflow.

WHAT IT CATCHES, verified by mutation rather than asserted:

* two commands reordered — caught. Typer prints in registration order, so a split that re-registers
  in a different order moves what a reader sees while every command still exists. This is the
  regression a file move actually produces.
* an option renamed — caught.
* a help string rewritten — caught.
* a command's PYTHON FUNCTION renamed — deliberately NOT caught, and that is the property the split
  depends on. Every command carries its name explicitly in `@app.command("...")`, so moving and
  renaming the implementation cannot move the surface.

WHEN THIS FAILS AND YOU MEANT IT: run `make gen-cli-surface`, commit the diff, and say in the
commit message what changed about `provael --help`. A diff here is adopter-visible.

IF YOU MUTATION-TEST THIS, CLEAR `__pycache__` BETWEEN MUTATIONS. Restoring `cli.py` with `cp`
gives it a fresh mtime, and CPython still served the mutated bytecode on the next run here — so a
snapshot regenerated after a "restore" captured the mutation instead of the real surface, and the
committed fixture had two commands in the wrong order while every check reported green. `find src
-name __pycache__ -type d -exec rm -rf {} +` between steps, or the guard verifies the mutation
against itself.
