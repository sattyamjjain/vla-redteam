# Seeding the calibration rollouts, and saying so honestly.
#
# WHY THESE EXIST. `PolicyAdapter.seed` was called from exactly one place in the codebase —
# `runner.run_episode`, the attack path. `collect_benign_signals` seeded the ENVIRONMENT and not
# the policy, so a flow-matching sampler like SmolVLA's drew its noise from ambient torch state.
# The ten `libero_object` zones committed on 6 September 2026 were fitted that way: the envelopes
# that every later measurement is scored against came from rollouts nobody can reproduce.
#
# The fix is two claims, and each is a way this can go wrong on its own, so each gets a test:
# the policy is seeded at all, and the artifact records what the adapter APPLIED rather than what
# the caller asked for. The second is the one that rots quietly — recording the requested seed
# would make every calibration claim a determinism no adapter delivered.
