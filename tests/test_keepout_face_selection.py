"""The replayed face-selection finding, pinned so it cannot drift unnoticed.

WHY A TEST AND NOT ONLY A STUDY. `studies/keepout_face_selection/` records that on the one
committed real-model run carrying trajectories, the fitted hazard face (`y-`) flags 0 of 12
attacked episodes while `x+` flags 5, and that five of the six faces give an identical 0.0 benign
rate. Those numbers are the entire argument for changing `fit_spatial_zone` and for leaving
`CALIBRATED_ZONES` empty. A study is prose: it goes stale silently the first time
`hazard_zone_beside`, `KeepOutZone.contains` or the trajectory codec changes shape.

WHAT WOULD BREAK THIS, and each is a reason to look rather than to re-baseline:

* a geometry change in `hazard_zone_beside` (which face `axis`/`side` names, how gap and depth
  compose) — the study's table is a direct read of that function
* a change to `KeepOutZone.contains` boundary handling
* the committed artifacts being re-fitted or re-measured, which is the legitimate case: update the
  study and this test together, in the same commit, and say what moved

The `0/12` on the fitted face is the assertion that matters most. If it ever becomes non-zero
without the underlying run changing, something has quietly altered what "inside the zone" means.
