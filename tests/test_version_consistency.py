"""One guard for every place the release version is restated.

`provael.__version__` is the single source of truth (hatch reads it to build the wheel), but the
version is echoed in a citation file, in the published Action's install pin, and in every
copy-paste CI snippet in the README, the docs and examples/. Those copies drift silently: nothing
imports them, so nothing notices when a release bumps the package and leaves them behind. They were
found at three different versions at once — 0.24.0 packaged, 0.22.0 in CITATION.cff, and 0.8.0 in
an examples snippet — and a snippet that pins a version users cannot get is worse than no snippet.

WHY THIS SCANS THE REPO INSTEAD OF A LIST OF FILES. The first version of this module checked five
named files. Two pins lived outside that list and drifted for exactly that reason:
``.github/workflows/checkpoint-security-gate.yml`` pinned the action at ``@v0.24.0`` — **a tag that
has never existed**, so the reference workflow a design partner is told to copy failed at ref
resolution — and ``.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`` documented ``v0.6.0`` as its rev, nineteen releases
stale. An allow-list can only guard what someone remembered to add to it, which is the one thing a
drifting pin is guaranteed not to be. So the scan now walks every tracked file and the *exemptions*
are the short, deliberate list.

Note the pins named in this docstring are written without their full syntax on purpose: this file
is scanned like any other, and spelling one out here would make the guard flag its own prose. The
exemption list stays for genuine historical records only, and a missing entry fails loudly rather
than passing silently — the safe direction for a check like this.

Two distinct failures are checked, because they are distinct:

1. **A pin that names a version that does not exist.** Fatal anywhere, including historical
   CHANGELOG entries: a ref that cannot resolve is broken wherever it appears.
2. **An adopter-facing pin that names an older release.** Fatal in copy-paste surfaces, but
   correct and expected in the CHANGELOG, where old entries legitimately name old versions.

These assertions are deliberately cheap and mechanical so a release can satisfy them by search and
replace.
