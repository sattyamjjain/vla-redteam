"""Run the real SmolVLA x LIBERO red-team path on a Modal GPU — fork-safe, ~$0.49/run.

Provael's core is CPU-tested in CI; the headline credibility move is a cheap, *real-model* job.
Modal (https://modal.com) spins up a GPU container on demand, runs the gated integration path,
and shuts down. Pair with examples/gpu-ci/modal-gpu-tests.yml, which only triggers on a
`gpu-tests` PR label so fork PRs can't spend.

WHAT THAT NUMBER COSTS, AND WHY IT USED TO BE WRONG. This file claimed ~$0.02/run and was never
recomputed after the run grew. `ATTACKS` expands to EIGHT arms (one baseline, three instruction,
two visual, two injection) and `task_ids` defaults to a single task, so the old `--seeds 10` was
80 episodes. The repo's measured anchor is 400 episodes in 15.4 L4-hours, ~139 s/episode, so 80
episodes is ~3 hours against the 1h `timeout` below: it could never finish, and every scheduled
run burned the full hour for nothing. Two seeds is 16 episodes, ~37 min, ~$0.49 at Modal's
$0.7992/L4-hour. Change SEEDS and you change the bill — recompute it here rather than trusting
this line.

    pip install modal
    modal run examples/gpu-ci/modal_provael_gpu.py

WHY THE APP IS BUILT AT GLOBAL SCOPE. It used to be constructed inside `build_app()` so the module
would import without modal installed. That is exactly what broke it: `modal run` scans a module's
GLOBAL scope for an app and its entrypoint, so with everything local to a function it found none
and reported "has no functions or local entrypoints" — for 22 days, while the scheduled workflow
reported success. `modal_libero_suite.py` records the same trap at its own line 83. Importability
without modal bought nothing (no test asserted it) and cost the measurement the badge exists for.

#: Seeds per arm. 8 arms x SEEDS x 1 task episodes, at ~139 s/episode measured, against the 1h
#: container timeout below. Two fits in ~37 min with real headroom; three is ~56 min and would
#: race the cap. The freshness badge this feeds carries a timestamp and no rate, so this is a
#: canary that the real-model path still runs — not a measurement, and not a published number.
SEEDS = "2"

#: Where the artifacts land, as ONE fact. It used to be the same string typed twice — once for the
#: CLI's `--out` inside the container, once for the mirror path in the local entrypoint — and the
#: workflow knew neither, so it went looking for `report.json` by modification time instead.
OUT_DIR = "runs/smolvla_libero"

#: The local entrypoint writes :data:`OUT_DIR` here, last, after the artifacts are on disk. The
#: workflow READS this file; it does not search.
#:
#: WHY THE SEARCH COULD NOT WORK. `gpu-scheduled.yml` ran
#: `find . -name report.json -newer gpu-scheduled-report.txt`, and that predicate is unsatisfiable
#: by construction: the entrypoint prints its closing line AFTER writing the artifacts, that line
#: goes through the same `tee` that produces the log, so the log's mtime is always newer than the
#: report it is announcing. On 4 September 2026 — the first scheduled run after #181's fix landed —
#: this lane reached a real policy, printed `Adversarial ASR: 33.3% (4/12)`, wrote three artifacts,
#: and the ledger step reported that it had produced none. Fourth time this lane has been unable to
#: report, after the nested app, the missing `pipefail`, and the discarded return value.
#:
#: The name is mirrored in `.github/workflows/gpu-scheduled.yml` and pinned by
#: `tests/test_modal_examples_are_runnable.py`, the same way every other cross-file contract in
#: this repo is held: copied deliberately, then guarded against drifting.
OUT_DIR_FILE = "gpu-scheduled-outdir.txt"

#: The exact provael release this canary installs. `tests/test_gpu_image_pin.py` asserts it equals
#: `provael.__version__`, so a release bump that forgets this line fails CI.
#:
#: THIS LANE WAS GENUINELY UNPINNED, which is a different bug from its sibling and has a different
#: consequence. `modal_libero_suite.py` pinned a commit and let it go stale; this file installed
#: `provael[lerobot]` with no constraint at all, so the canary measured whatever PyPI served on the
#: morning it ran. That is not reproducible in either direction: the same image definition builds
#: different code next week, and a report from last month cannot be re-run against what produced
#: it. It also silently split the two lanes — on 6 September 2026 the canary resolved 0.39.1 while
#: the measurement arm was fitting zones on 0.32.0, so the two GPU lanes were measuring builds five
#: releases apart while both looked healthy.
#:
#: A canary's job is to be recent, which is an argument for tracking the newest release, not for
#: tracking it implicitly. Pinning and asserting against `__version__` gives the same currency and
#: says which build produced the number.
