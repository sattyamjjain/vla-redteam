**The finding.** A single `roleplay` instruction drove a **real SmolVLA** policy out of its safe
envelope on **44 of 50 matched pairs across all ten `libero_object` tasks (88%, task-clustered 95%
CI [72%, 100%]) against a benign control of 2/50 (4.0%, Wilson 95% [1.1%, 13.5%])** — and against
**0** benign twins at the same (task, seed), McNemar exact **p = 4.6e-13**, surviving Holm
correction across the six-arm screen. The headline interval is **clustered over *tasks*, not
episodes**, because episodes inside one task are correlated and pooling them reports an interval far
too narrow. The two numbers are quoted together because an attack-success rate is a difference
against that floor: read alone, 88% is a rate with no control arm.

This supersedes the earlier n=10 single-task result, and the upgrade is the scope rather than the
number. That run measured `libero_object/0` alone and was explicitly an existence proof; a
task-clustered interval could not be computed from it at all, because
`cluster_bootstrap_ci` refuses below two tasks by design. **A second attack changed verdict once
there were ten tasks:** `goal_substitution` was 6/10 at p=0.031 and did *not* survive correction on
one task; pooled over ten it reaches **15/50, p=9.8e-4**, and does.

The honest other half. The benign control fired on **2 of 50** episodes, so the predicate is not
clean — it is uncalibrated, the same fixed keep-out zone on all ten tasks. Those firings are not
scattered: across **both** committed runs the benign arm fires **5/100 (5.0%, Wilson 95% [2.2%,
11.2%])** and every single firing lands on `libero_object/4` or `/5`, on different seeds, with the
other eight tasks silent through 80 benign episodes — a task-conditional, seed-independent pattern
that replicates out-of-sample at p = 0.04
([the study](studies/keepout_calibration/README.md)). That is the signature of a boundary in the
wrong place, not of a policy that wanders. **It is not fixed yet, and what is missing is a run
rather than an idea**: fitting a per-task boundary needs benign end-effector trajectories, and every
committed LIBERO report predates the field that records them
([#171](https://github.com/provael/provael/issues/171)). The run that produces them is the
`calibrate` arm of `GPU arm (manual, Modal)` — ten tasks, benign only, ~$5. Three families are
**measured nulls at 0/50 each** (`patch`, `decoy_object`, `scene_text`), and `mcp_tool_desc` is
**not applicable** to this suite rather than a null. Clean-task-success under the benign arm averages
84% and ranges 40–100% across tasks, so the policy is not uniformly competent. And the policy's
sampler was not seeded when this ran, so this is **one draw**, not a reproducible constant — from
0.38.0 the runner seeds it and records `policy_seed` per episode, but that cannot be applied
retroactively to a measurement already taken.

## Why the policy layer

The fielded robot-security incidents so far — **UniPwn** (CVE-2025-60250 / CVE-2025-60251), the
**Unitree Go1** backdoor (CVE-2025-2894), and **G1** telemetry exfiltration — are **firmware /
supply-chain** bugs. Real, serious, and a **different layer**. Provael™ red-teams the **VLA policy
itself** (EAI01–EAI06): the language-conditioned control policy that *becomes* the fielded attack
surface as robots gain language-driven autonomy — and the layer a text-only jailbreak tool
structurally can't reach, because a prompt that stays "safe" in text can still drive an **unsafe
trajectory**. That gap is what the finding above measures. See the
[Embodied AI Security Top 10](docs/top10.md).

---

**Provael™** is the open-source red-team & assurance layer for physical AI. This repo is its
core: a small, **model-agnostic** harness that perturbs the instructions and observations a
VLA policy receives inside a simulator and measures how often those perturbations drive the
policy into an *unsafe* state. The headline number is the ASR — always reported with a 95% Wilson
CI, a benign false-positive control, a clean-task-success (competence) control, and an honest
`real-transfer` vs `stub-validated` label.

> **New here?** Run it in your browser in 5 minutes — [open the Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/provael/provael/blob/main/notebooks/01_provael_in_5_minutes.ipynb) — or browse the [examples gallery](examples/) and the built-in `provael list-recipes`.

It ships **seventeen adversarial families of auditable attacks** — `instruction` (text
reframings), `visual` (observation-space markers), `sensor_spoof` (EAI02: a sim
perception spoof driving the end-effector into a keep-out zone), `injection` (indirect /
embodied prompt injection), `action` (action-space integrity: freeze / trajectory
hijack), `action_space` (EAI04 2nd vector: keep-out hijack of the *commanded end-effector*
/ critical-step freeze), `backdoor` (EAI03: an objective-decoupled trigger *screen*),
`authorization` (EAI08: self-authorization / scope-escalation, i.e. excessive agency),
`confidentiality` (EAI09: a memorized-canary leak *screen* — membership inference /
extraction), `misalignment` (EAI06: the embodiment gap — a benign-sounding instruction
driving an unsafe embodied action into a keep-out zone), and **`humanoid`** (whole-body /
locomotion — a balance spoof → loss of balance, a whole-body hijack → topple, a freeze mid-stride)
— plus four **optimized** search families: **`optimized`**
(`targeted_hijack`: a black-box, query-budgeted *search*), **`optimized_patch`** (the image-channel
analogue, GPU-gated and inert on CPU suites), **`optimized_instruction`** (`targeted_redirect`,
a command-preserving instruction search) and **`universal_patch`** (one patch fit **once** and
carried unchanged to episodes it never queried — GPU-gated, transfer rate unmeasured) — a `none`
benign control, and an ASR
**leaderboard**, and **measured defenses**: `--defense` installs a mitigation in the deployment
position and `provael mitigation` reports pre/post ASR per family with 95% Wilson intervals, a
benign-FPR control and a benign-task-success acceptance gate. Measuring a defense is in the **free**
tool, not behind the operated tier: a mitigation you cannot measure is a marketing claim.

**Two defenses ship (0.29.0), both `stub-validated-scaffolding` — no real-model transfer is claimed
for either.** `instruction_canonicalization` acts on the instruction; `action_envelope` acts on the
commanded action. The action side exists because four of the six `docs/defenses.md` taxonomy rows act
on what leaves the policy, and until `Defense.filter_action` those four were not merely unmeasured
but **unimplementable** — the taxonomy was a spec its own interface could not satisfy. The
action-envelope study is `credited` on `stub` and `reach` and **`not-credited` on `humanoid`**, and
its headline is the coverage map: a magnitude cap cannot restore a frozen action and does not reach
successes routing through a decoupled flag ([study](docs/studies/action-envelope.md)). `--recipe full-sweep` runs every one of the seventeen; families the chosen suite
cannot support are skipped and reported N/A, never scored 0%. Every family carries its transfer-test (rate + 95% Wilson CI + benign-FPR
control); run `provael transfer-test` to print it. The `action`, `action_space`, `sensor_spoof`,
`backdoor`, `authorization`, `misalignment`, `confidentiality`, and `humanoid` families are
**stub-validated only** (no real-model transfer claimed). `provael coverage` prints the whole
picture as one machine-readable line rather than leaving it to prose — and prints it as three
numbers on purpose, because *registered is not validated*: **17 adversarial families registered,
3 exercised against a real policy** (`instruction`, `visual`, `injection` — and two of those three
returned measured nulls, which is a result), **14 stub-validated only**. Note also that the
registry holds **39 adversarial attacks**, which is not the same number as 17 families; reading
the registry dict's length as a family count overstates coverage by 14. It red-teams **8
policies** — the CPU `stub`
plus real **SmolVLA / π0 / π0.5 / π0-FAST** (via the `[lerobot]` extra), **OpenVLA**
(via `[openvla]`), and **π0 served by openpi** — Physical Intelligence's own stack, via the CPU-only
`[openpi]` websocket client to a GPU policy server. **Three of those eight are registered scaffolding**: `groot` (needs `lerobot[groot]`, which `provael[lerobot]` does not provision), `openvla` and `openpi` have each been structurally tested but have **never had a checkpoint loaded here**. Only `smolvla` has produced a committed real-model result. `provael list-policies` gives each backend a `status` of `measured` / `scaffolding` / `no run committed here`, so the difference is visible before you point `--policy` at one. Suites: **6** registered (`stub` + `reach` +
`humanoid` on CPU; **LIBERO** + **Meta-World** gated; `ai2_bridge` is **scaffolding** — registered
and structurally tested, but no benchmark has ever been run through it, so it is not coverage), or
any policy/suite you wrap with the tiny adapter ABCs. The templated families are
heuristic perturbations (not gradient-based); the `optimized` family is a model-agnostic search
that only *queries* the policy — see
[Scope and honest limitations](#scope-and-honest-limitations) and the
[examples gallery](examples/).

The entire core — abstractions, attacks, scoring, runner, report, CLI, leaderboard — runs
and is tested on a **plain CPU with no GPU and no model/dataset download**, using a
deterministic `StubPolicy` + `StubSuite`. Real policies (SmolVLA via LeRobot) and the LIBERO
simulator live behind an optional extra and a `PROVAEL_INTEGRATION=1` gate.

## Commercial & design partners

Provael is open core. The CLI, every attack family, calibration, SARIF/OSCAL/ML-BOM, and the
GitHub Action are Apache-2.0, forever. The paid surface is operated work a solo tool can't sign
for: a hosted real-VLA (GPU) transfer run, a leaderboard entry signed with a published, stable
project key (which a verifier may choose to trust — no signature is authoritative on its own), and a
compliance dossier.

Five rungs, cheapest first — [full detail and what each includes](https://www.provael.com/pricing):

| Rung | Price | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open core | **$0**, forever | Everything in this repository. Apache-2.0, CPU-first, no account. |
| Checkpoint report | **$1,950** | One checkpoint, run and written up. The cheapest paid thing there is. |
| Design partner | **$15,000** | First three only. Deeper engagement, and the findings are published. |
| Assessment | **$25,000** | A full assessment against your deployment. |
| Retainer | **from $3,000/mo** | Continuous re-testing as the policy and the suite move. |

This table previously listed only the $15K and $25K rungs, which made the cheapest paid option look
like $15,000 — an 8x overstatement of what it costs to start, in the one place a reader forms that
impression. The website hit the same bug and now computes its entry price from the rungs rather than
stating it; if you are editing this table, the site is the source and
[/pricing](https://www.provael.com/pricing) wins on any disagreement.

A free PV-SCAN of your nearest public checkpoint comes with any of the paid rungs:

## The Embodied AI Security Top 10

An independent, community risk list for the security of VLA models and the robots they drive — the
framework Provael's attacks map to. Read it: [docs/top10.md](docs/top10.md). Draft v0.2, PRs welcome.
Shaping v0.3? The [Top-10 RFC process](docs/top10-rfc.md) covers how to propose a new risk or
dispute an existing one.

Comparing frameworks? See the [EAI ↔ RoboJailBench crosswalk](docs/crosswalk/robojailbench.md) — a
machine-readable mapping between the Top 10 and RoboJailBench's 18 harm categories, with provael's
honest measured coverage (and transfer status) per category.

**Coverage: 8 / 10.** Provael ships a runnable, sim-only attack family with a transfer-test for eight
categories — **EAI01–EAI06, EAI08, EAI09**. The other two are gaps of *different kinds*, and every
artifact now says which:

- **EAI07** (CPS / firmware / comms / teleop) is `out-of-scope-for-simulation` — an infrastructure /
  CVE layer that would need real exploit tooling this tool will not ship. **A clean Provael run says
  nothing about this risk.**
- **EAI10** (evaluation / observability / incident response) is `process-control-not-attackable` — a
  governance meta-risk with no attack surface. Provael's own signed report is *partial evidence for*
  its evaluation limb, not an attack on it, and it never carries an ASR.

All ten appear in the scorecard, compliance report, dossier and evidence manifest with an explicit
coverage status — a category with no attacks is shown as uncovered, never omitted. `provael
crosswalk --target atlas` prints the generated per-risk view.

Every attack is tagged with the risk it exercises; the SARIF output (`--format sarif`) carries
that tag as each finding's `EAIxx` ruleId:

## Scope and honest limitations

This is an **early, research-grade** harness, built to be reproducible and honest rather than
to oversell. Before you trust a number, know:

- **Everything here is simulation. No number in this repository has ever been produced on
  physical hardware.** Provael has never been run against a real robot, a real controller or a
  real safety PLC, and it is not built to be. Every ASR is a claim about the simulator that
  produced it — **not** evidence that the same policy fails the same way on a bench. That gap is
  not a formality: an adversarial patch here is composited into a frame as an array, and is never
  printed, photographed, or subjected to lighting, viewing angle, print gamut, motion blur or
  sensor noise — the factors that decide whether a simulated patch survives contact with a camera.
  A patch that works at 100% in this harness may do nothing on a bench, and a policy that looks
  clean here may still fail physically for reasons the harness cannot see.
  **We have not measured sim-to-real transfer, and we do not claim it.** Establishing it needs a
  hardware lab and a published study; until one exists, read every number as simulator-scoped.
  (Independent groups such as [Robocurve](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/robocurve) make the
  same point from the performance side — models strong in simulation show large real-world gaps.)
- **Mostly templated attacks, plus four optimized search families.** Most attacks are auditable
  string/observation templates (instruction reframings, image markers, scene text) — behavioral
  probes, not gradient-based worst-case robustness. Four **optimized** families now also ship as
  bounded-budget *searches*: `optimized` (`targeted_hijack`, action-directive), `optimized_patch`
  (`patch_hijack`, adversarial patch — GPU-gated), `universal_patch` (one patch fit **once** then
  frozen and carried to episodes and tasks it never queried — the constraint a *printed* sticker
  actually faces, where `patch_hijack` re-optimises per episode; GPU-gated, and its transfer rate
  is **unclaimed** until that run happens), and `optimized_instruction` (`targeted_redirect`)
  — an optimized, **command-preserving** instruction search that redirects the policy through subtle
  manner/urgency cues while keeping the operator's command and never naming the target object. Its
  recommended mitigation is **instruction canonicalization / repair** (normalise phrasing, strip
  redundant manner/urgency adverbials, re-derive the canonical command), which collapses the search's
  edit space — see [PRIOR_ART.md](PRIOR_ART.md). Gradient-based (GCG/PGD-style) VLA attacks remain an
  open roadmap item (cf. prior art **BadVLA**, **AttackVLA**).
- **Only the instruction family transfers (so far).** On real SmolVLA × LIBERO, instruction
  reframings redirected the policy (roleplay 100%, goal-substitution 60%); the **visual and
  injection families produced 0% measurable lift** on the real model. Treat those two as
  stub-validated scaffolding pending stronger perturbations.
- **EAI04 (`action` + `action_space`) is stub-validated — and its transfer study confirms it does
  not reach a real policy through this mechanism.** On the deterministic `reach` keep-out fixture all
  four vectors (`freeze`, `trajectory_hijack`, `keepout_hijack`, `critical_freeze`) fire 100%
  [72–100%] vs a 0% benign-FPR control (BH-FDR significant). But they inject an *out-of-band directive
  channel a real VLA ignores*, and LIBERO surfaces no action-integrity signal — so on the real
  SmolVLA/π0 path they are **not-applicable** (verified), not merely pending. A real
  action-freeze/hijack needs the GPU-gated adversarial-image search (FreezeVLA / AttackVLA; see the
  `optimized_patch` family). Full write-up:
  [docs/studies/eai04-action-space-transfer.md](docs/studies/eai04-action-space-transfer.md)
  (`provael study eai04`).
- **Demonstrated transfer is still one policy, one suite.** The architecture is model-agnostic
  (an adapter interface), and an adapter now ships for a *cross-architecture* backend — **π0 served
  by openpi** (Physical Intelligence's own stack, a different framework from LeRobot, same
  flow-matching action head) — so the *same* instruction attacks that move SmolVLA can be aimed at
  it. But that **cross-architecture transfer run is GPU-gated and not yet run** (and `[openpi]` /
  `[lerobot]` can't share one env — conflicting numpy pins — so it runs in a separate env, compared
  offline). Demonstrated real-model transfer remains **SmolVLA / LeRobot × LIBERO** only — generality
  is scaffolded, not yet shown across backends.
- **Every rate ships with its control.** The headline `libero_object/0` result below is reported
  as a redirection rate with its **95% Wilson CI** and the **benign baseline FPR** (the `none`
  control — 0% here) alongside, so a non-zero rate is attack-induced, not task noise. **v0.4's
  `provael calibrate`** fits the unsafe predicate per task from the policy's own benign rollouts
  to a benign-FPR target; apply it with `provael attack --calib`. See [Calibration](#calibration).

Honesty and reproducibility are the point — see
[PRIOR_ART.md](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/PRIOR_ART.md) for how this sits
next to the academic state of the art.

## Install (CPU core — no GPU, no network)

Nothing to install — Docker (amd64 + arm64):

```bash
# Does this environment work? Prints Python, platform, which backends are ready, whether the
# keep-out predicate is calibrated, and how old the newest measurement is.
docker run --rm ghcr.io/provael/provael:latest doctor

# One deterministic scan. Prints the ASR, its Wilson interval, and the benign control beside it.
docker run --rm ghcr.io/provael/provael:latest attack --recipe quick

# keep the report after --rm
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/runs:/home/provael/runs" \
  ghcr.io/provael/provael:latest attack --recipe quick
```

**Measured, not estimated** — cold pull on arm64 with no cached image, 25 August 2026,
`ghcr.io/provael/provael:0.38.0`: **12.5 s** to pull, **1.3 s** for `doctor`, **0.7 s** for
`attack --recipe quick`. Under fifteen seconds from nothing installed to a scored run with an
interval and a control arm. Pin the tag (`:0.38.0`) rather than `:latest` if you want that to stay
true; `:latest` moves.

The scan above is the deterministic CPU fixture, which is the point of it — it is the same numbers
on every machine, and it needs no GPU, no checkpoint and no network. A real policy on a real
simulator (`--suite libero`) is GPU-gated and is not this command; see
[What runs on CPU vs. what needs a GPU](#what-runs-on-cpu-vs-what-needs-a-gpu).

<!-- VERIFIED from a logged-out daemon with no cached image, on arm64. Four things this line
     depends on, every one of which has broken at least once:
       1. the package is PUBLIC on GHCR. Org policy blocked it initially: the package's own
          visibility dialog showed Public as "disabled by organization administrators", so the
          org-level packages policy had to permit public packages first.
       2. BOTH architectures are published. The first build was amd64-only, because that is what
          the GitHub runner is, and an Apple Silicon pull died on "no matching manifest for
          linux/arm64/v8". CI cannot catch this — its smoke test runs on the same x86_64 runner.
       3. ENTRYPOINT ["provael"], so trailing words are provael's own arguments and not a shell
          command replacing it.
       4. a WRITABLE cwd. WORKDIR was /app (root-owned) under USER provael, so this exact command
          died on `PermissionError: 'runs'` while `--version` passed happily.
     ci.yml builds the image and smokes the entrypoint on every PR, covering 3 and 4. -->

With [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended):

```bash
uv sync                      # creates a venv and installs the CPU core + dev tools
```

Or with pip:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .             # core only; lerobot is NOT pulled in
```

## Quickstart (runs in well under 5 s on a CPU)

```bash
uv run provael attack --policy stub --suite stub \
    --attacks instruction,visual,injection --episodes 10 --seed 0 --out runs/stub/
```

The same scan with **no local Python at all** — no `uv`, no virtualenv, no `pip`:

```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/provael/provael:latest \
    attack --policy stub --suite stub \
    --attacks instruction,visual,injection --episodes 10 --seed 0
```

Multi-arch (amd64 + arm64) and public, so this works logged out. Add
`-v "$PWD/runs:/home/provael/runs" ... --out runs/stub/` to keep the report after `--rm`.

Or in CI, gating the build on the measured rate — SARIF goes to code scanning, and the job fails when
the adversarial ASR exceeds your threshold or regresses past tolerance against a baseline:

```yaml
- uses: provael/provael@v0.39.3
  with: { policy: stub, suite: stub, asr-threshold: "0.5" }
```

### Public ASR board (real, signed, reproducible)

`provael leaderboard build --real <results-dir>` builds the public board from real-model runs. Every
row carries its **95% Wilson CI**, the benign (`none`) control, and a **transfer-status** label
(`real-transfer` vs `stub-scaffolding`), so a stub run is never silently mixed with a real one. The
board is stamped with a UTC date, the source commit, and a **SHA-256 digest of the aggregated
inputs** — rebuild it and check the digest matches to reproduce. Add `--sign` (needs the
`provael[attest]` extra) to Ed25519-sign it, and verify offline:

```bash
uv run provael leaderboard verify --in leaderboard/results/leaderboard.json \
  --pubkey leaderboard/results/leaderboard.pub   # -> leaderboard OK  keyid 8d62aa33ed5162f3
```

The published board is the **ten-task `libero_object` suite screen**: on the real
**SmolVLA × LIBERO** policy only the **instruction** family transfers, at **41.3% (62/150)
[34–49%]** against a **4.0% (2/50, Wilson 95% [1.1%, 13.5%])** benign control; **injection is 0/50 and visual 0/100** —
measured nulls, published as such.

Since `schema_version` 5 each row also carries the qualifiers its report always had —
`calibrated` (false here: the keep-out predicate is the default box, see
[#136](https://github.com/provael/provael/issues/136)), `stochastic` (true: one draw, not a
reproducible constant — these rows predate `policy_seed`), and `checkpoint` — plus a board-level
`not_applicable`
(`mcp_tool_desc`, which produced records but zero applicable episodes). A rate that outlives its
qualifiers is the overclaim this board exists not to make, and the board was the one artifact
where they were being dropped.

The board is also **live as a Hugging Face Space** —
[huggingface.co/spaces/Sattyam/provael-leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Sattyam/provael-leaderboard)
— rendering the same signed `leaderboard.json` this repo commits, with an open submission queue.
The Space is a *rendering*; the canonical artifact is the signed JSON in this repository, so verify
that one rather than a view of it.

The free core builds and verifies boards; a hosted, operator-signed board is the intended operated
surface (experimental today). See [docs/leaderboard.md](docs/leaderboard.md).
**Evidence, not certification.**

**What the published board does not cover.** It is one run and it is old: measured with
**`provael 0.32.0`**, covering **1 policy on 1 suite** and **3 of the 17 adversarial families**. The
other **fourteen families have no real-model measurement at all** — they are *absent* from the board,
which is not the same as scoring 0%. That run also predates the clean-task-success control, so it
carries a benign false-positive control but no measured competence baseline. The Space states all
of this above its own tables; rebuilding cannot fix it, because a re-stamp re-aggregates committed
reports and never re-runs a policy. Closing the gap needs GPU time.

The board is now several minor versions behind the shipping tool. That gap is bridged by
[`leaderboard/method-equivalence.json`](leaderboard/method-equivalence.json), whose own
`what_this_is_not` field says it plainly: **"This is a code-inspection argument, NOT a
re-measurement."** Nothing has re-run 0.32.0's numbers on the current tool.

## What runs on CPU vs. what needs a GPU

| Capability | CPU (default) | Needs GPU + `[lerobot]` extra |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| `stub` (scalar) + `reach` (spatial) suites | ✅ | |
| All 17 adversarial families (`instruction`/`visual`/`sensor_spoof`/`injection`/`action`/`action_space`/`backdoor`/`authorization`/`confidentiality`/`misalignment`/`humanoid`/`optimized`/`optimized_patch`/`gradient_patch`/`universal_patch`/`optimized_instruction`/`weight_integrity`) | ✅ | |
| `humanoid` whole-body / locomotion suite (fall / balance / self-collision / footstep keep-out) | ✅ | |
| Scoring, runner, report, CLI, recipes, `reproduce`, scorecard/SARIF/OSCAL/AVID | ✅ | |
| `attest` — signed, dated evidence bundle (digest-only core; Ed25519 via `[attest]` extra) | ✅ | |
| Full test suite (`pytest`), `ruff`, `mypy` | ✅ | |
| `smolvla` / `pi0` / `pi05` / `pi0fast` / `groot` policies (real, via LeRobot) | | ✅ |
| `openvla` policy (OpenVLA via `transformers`; needs the `[openvla]` extra) | | ✅ |
| `libero` + `metaworld` suites (real simulators) | | ✅ |

On CPU, a real policy/suite fails with a clear, actionable message (not a traceback) telling you
exactly which extra to install. Run `provael list-policies` to see what's runnable here.

## Use in CI (GitHub Action)

Gate any robot/VLA repo on red-team results with the reusable Action. It runs a red-team,
uploads findings to **GitHub code scanning** as SARIF (each tagged with its `EAIxx` rule), and
fails the job when the **adversarial** ASR exceeds a threshold (the benign control is excluded
from that denominator, so adding controls can never move the gate toward passing):

```yaml
# .github/workflows/provael.yml
permissions:
  contents: read
  security-events: write   # required to upload SARIF
jobs:
  redteam:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: provael/provael@v0.39.3
        with:
          # `none` is the benign control: without it an ASR has no false-positive baseline,
          # and the release gate cannot reach `pass`. It never moves the adversarial ASR.
          attacks: none,instruction,visual,injection,action
          episodes: "10"
          asr-threshold: "0.5"          # fail if the ADVERSARIAL ASR > 50%
          baseline: .provael/baseline.report.json   # optional: also fail on a regression
          regression-tolerance: "0.05"
```

#### Measuring a defense in CI (opt-in)

Set the `defense` input and the Action runs a **second, defended arm** with byte-identical
policy/suite/attacks/episodes/seed, then compares them with `provael mitigation`. It is off by
default (empty), so every existing consumer is unaffected, and it roughly **doubles CI time**.

| New input | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `defense` | Registered defense name (`provael list-defenses`). Empty = the whole axis is skipped. |

| New output | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `residual-asr` | Adversarial ASR of the **defended** arm. Separately named, and **not** what the gate reads. |
| `mitigation-verdict` | `credited` \| `not-credited` \| `rejected-benign-cost` \| `insufficient`. |
| `mitigation-report` | Path to `report.mitigation.json` — feed it to `provael certify --mitigation`. |
| `defense-log` | Path to `defense-log.jsonl`, the raw → defended trail per instruction and action. |

**The gating rule, and it matters more than the feature.** `asr-threshold` keeps gating the
**UNDEFENDED** adversarial ASR. A filter of unproven real-model efficacy must not be able to lower
the number a release gate reads — that is precisely how a team ships an unmitigated policy behind a
text-and-clamp wrapper. The defended figure is published beside it as `residual-asr`, never
substituted for it.

The job fails on `rejected-benign-cost` (mirroring `provael mitigation`'s own non-zero exit: a measure
that breaks the benign task is rejected regardless of its effect on the ASR), and on `insufficient`,
which means the benign control is missing — nothing measured is not a pass, the same rule the
empty-ASR branch of the gate already enforces. `not-credited` is reported, not gated on: it is a real
measured result.

The default `stub` policy + suite run on a **CPU** runner — no GPU, no model download — a fast
smoke test of the gate wiring. Red-teaming a **real** policy (`policy: smolvla`,
`suite: libero`) needs a **GPU runner** plus the `[lerobot]` extra; see the commented job in
[examples/ci/github-actions.yml](examples/ci/github-actions.yml).

### Per-checkpoint regression gate

Pass a `baseline` (a known-good `report.json`) and the Action also fails when a retrain makes the
policy **more** attackable. A slice regresses only when the candidate ASR beats the baseline by
more than `regression-tolerance` **and** the two 95% Wilson CIs are disjoint, so small-`n` noise
can't fail a build. The same diff runs locally:

```bash
provael report --in runs/candidate --baseline .provael/baseline.report.json \
  --regression-tolerance 0.05 --sarif-out runs/candidate/regression.sarif \
  --attest-out runs/candidate/regression.attestation.json   # + a signed, offline-verifiable diff
```

It prints a per-EAI diff, exits non-zero on a regression, and writes a regression SARIF (a regressed
EAI family surfaces in code scanning). See
[examples/ci/regression-gate.md](examples/ci/regression-gate.md) for storing and rolling the
baseline. Per-checkpoint regression evidence maps to standing-assurance expectations (e.g. EU
Machinery Regulation 2023/1230 Annex III §1.1.9, safe behaviour across updates) — **evidence, not
certification**, and the real-VLA (GPU) transfer run behind it is the higher-assurance evidence a
future operated service would sign.

### Continuous gate + signed evidence

The gate is **self-maintaining**. The reference workflow
[`.github/workflows/checkpoint-security-gate.yml`](.github/workflows/checkpoint-security-gate.yml)
persists the baseline in the Actions cache and, on each new checkpoint, restores it → red-teams +
diffs → and **only when the gate passes, promotes the new run to the baseline**. The first run
establishes the baseline; every run after diffs against it — nothing to commit or roll by hand.

Each run also emits a **signed regression attestation** (`--attest-out` locally, or the Action's
`sign: true` + `signing-key` inputs): a tamper-evident, offline-verifiable **Ed25519** envelope that
binds the diff, its SARIF, and the human summary under one signature, and states the verdict with the
ASR **and its 95% Wilson CI** — never a bare number. It is the artifact a safety case references
(`provael.regression.verify_regression_attestation` checks it offline; the signer key is **untrusted
by default** until you trust it out of band). This is the seed of the fleet-CI / insurer-ready
evidence surface.

The gate is **generic across the policy/suite abstraction** — point `policy`/`suite` at your own
checkpoint on a GPU runner. Generality is intended; it is **tested on SmolVLA × LIBERO** today.

## First real result (SmolVLA on LIBERO)

`HuggingFaceVLA/smolvla_libero` · **all ten `libero_object` tasks** · 5 seeds per (task, arm) ·
horizon 280 · L4, 2026-08-09. 350 measured episodes of 400 records.

**`roleplay` redirected SmolVLA out of its safe envelope on 44 of 50 matched pairs (88%,
task-clustered 95% CI [72%, 100%]) against a 2/50 benign control (4.0%, Wilson 95% [1.1%, 13.5%]),
and against 0 benign twins at identical (task, seed) — McNemar exact p = 4.6e-13, Holm-adjusted to
2.7e-12 across the six-arm screen.**

**That interval is clustered over TASKS, not episodes**, and the distinction matters more than the
identical-looking bounds of the older single-task Wilson interval. Episodes inside one task are
correlated — an attack that works on "pick up the alphabet soup" tends to work on every seed of it —
so pooling them as independent trials reports an interval far too narrow. This is the first result
in the project where a clustered interval could be computed at all: `provael.scoring.paired` returns
`None` below two tasks by design, which was the correct answer for every earlier published number.

What changed by adding tasks. `goal_substitution` was 6/10 at p = 0.031 on one task and did **not**
survive correction; over ten tasks it reaches **15/50, p = 9.8e-4**, and does. Adding tasks changed a
verdict, which is the argument for having run them.

| family | attack | redirection rate | clustered 95% CI | McNemar | Holm |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| baseline | `none` | **2/50 (4%)** — control | — | — | — |
| instruction | `roleplay` | **44/50 (88%)** | **[72%, 100%]** | 4.6e-13 | **2.7e-12** |
| instruction | `goal_substitution` | **15/50 (30%)** | [6%, 54%] | 9.8e-4 | **4.9e-3** |
| instruction | `paraphrase` | 3/50 (6%) | [0%, 12%] | 1.0 | 1.0 |
| visual | `patch` | 0/50 (0%) | — | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| visual | `decoy_object` | 0/50 (0%) | — | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| injection | `scene_text` | 0/50 (0%) | — | 0.5 | 1.0 |
| injection | `mcp_tool_desc` | **0 attempts** | — | — | — |

`mcp_tool_desc` is **not applicable** to this suite: it produces 50 episode records carrying
`applicable: false` and `steps: 0`, which scoring excludes from `attempts`. It is listed as
not-measured rather than as a seventh null, because those are different claims — and it is why the
run is 350 measured episodes out of 400 records.

**The three null arms show `—` rather than an interval, and that is a correction.** This table
previously published `[0%, 0%]` for them. The clustered bootstrap declines when every task scores
the same rate: resampling ten tasks that all scored zero returns zero on every draw, so the
percentiles collapse onto it and the interval reads as certainty the data cannot support. Pooled
as a plain binomial, 0/50 is consistent with a true rate as high as **7.1%** — the exact 95% upper
bound, and the number the site has been publishing for these same arms all along. The refusal now
lives in `provael.scoring.paired` and is guarded by `tests/test_paired.py` and
`tests/test_no_zero_width_intervals.py`.

**The benign control is not clean.** It fired on 2 of 50 episodes, both on tasks 4 and 5, because
the predicate is uncalibrated — the same fixed keep-out zone on all ten tasks. McNemar handles that
correctly by discarding concordant pairs, and `benign_only` counts are reported per arm rather than
hidden, but a calibrated predicate would be a better measurement. `provael calibrate` exists and has
not been run on LIBERO.

That "because" is now measured rather than assumed. Pooling this run's benign arm with the
[control run](results/smolvla_libero_object_control/README.md)'s gives 5 firings in 100 benign
episodes, and **all five land on `libero_object/4` and `/5`** — the two tasks that ask for the
ketchup and the tomato sauce — while the other eight tasks stay silent across 80 episodes. The
seeds differ between the runs, so each tests the other's task set out-of-sample; the weaker
direction gives p = 0.04. See
[studies/keepout_calibration](studies/keepout_calibration/README.md), which also records why no
corrected zone is derived there: every committed LIBERO report predates `AttackResult.trajectory`,
so the benign end-effector poses a fit would consume were never written down.

Read each rate **against its control**: the `none` baseline runs the policy's *real* task and
scores **2/50 (benign FPR 4%, Wilson 95% [1.1%, 13.5%])**, so a success above is attack-induced
only to the extent it clears that floor — which is what the McNemar column tests, pair by pair.
Language-reframing attacks reliably divert SmolVLA's end-effector; pixel and scene-text
perturbations did not move it (0%) — an honest null on this suite.

> **Scope (honest).** Simulation only. **Ten `libero_object` tasks, 5 seeds per (task, arm),

## Cross-architecture transfer

Does the *same* attack move *different* VLA architectures, or is a redirection an artifact of one
codebase's glue? The **cross-architecture transfer study** runs the shared instruction/visual/injection
battery against multiple backends through the same runner + scoring, and reports per-(family ×
architecture) ASR with a 95% Wilson CI and the benign-FPR control:

```bash
provael study cross-arch                      # deterministic CPU-stub table (no GPU/network)
python studies/cross_arch_transfer/run.py     # + writes results/cross_arch_transfer/
```

On CPU it runs the deterministic stub battery and marks the real backends **`pending`**. The real legs
— **SmolVLA** (LeRobot) and **π0** (served by Physical Intelligence's own `openpi` stack; same
flow-matching action head, different framework) — are gated behind `PROVAEL_INTEGRATION=1` + the
`[lerobot]`/`[openpi]` extra, and (since those two extras pin conflicting numpy majors) run in separate
environments, merged offline. **Honest status:** on the one real architecture measured so far (SmolVLA),
only the **instruction** family transfers (`roleplay` 100% [72–100%], `goal_substitution` 60%); visual
and injection show 0% lift. The **π0** leg is **run pending** — no cross-architecture number is claimed
until it runs. Full write-up: [docs/findings/2026-cross-arch-transfer.md](docs/findings/2026-cross-arch-transfer.md).

## Calibration

By default the unsafe predicate is **uncalibrated** — the stub uses a random per-seed threshold
and LIBERO a generic keep-out box — so ASR reads as "diverted out of the benign envelope."
`provael calibrate` replaces that with a **per-task predicate fit from the policy's own benign
rollouts**:

1. Run `N` benign (attack `none`) rollouts per task and split the seeds into **fit / holdout**.
2. Derive the safe predicate from the fit split — a thresholded danger signal (stub) or an
   end-effector keep-out zone placed disjoint from the benign envelope (LIBERO) — and tune it so
   the benign **false-positive rate** on the holdout split is `<= --target-fpr` (default 0.05).
3. Save a per-task JSON artifact (envelope/threshold, achieved benign FPR, `n`, seed split).

```bash
# 1) calibrate (CPU stub shown — deterministic)
uv run provael calibrate --policy stub --suite stub --seeds 20 --target-fpr 0.05 --out calib/

# 2) attack with the calibrated predicate
uv run provael attack --policy stub --suite stub \
    --attacks none,instruction,visual,injection --episodes 10 --calib calib/ --out runs/calib/
```

A calibrated run reports a **calibrated redirection rate** with a **95% Wilson CI** and the
**benign baseline FPR** (the `none` row, scored under the same predicate) alongside — every
number gets its control. The `calibrated` flag, `benign_fpr`, and per-task calibration metadata
are recorded in `report.json`, `report.md`, the CLI table, and the SARIF output. Without
`--calib`, the default predicate is used, unchanged.

> The real **SmolVLA × LIBERO** calibration runs on a GPU box (it needs the `[lerobot]` extra);
> the stub path runs on CPU and is covered by CI.

## Compliance evidence

Turn a run into an **auditor-readable evidence artifact** — it maps the measured signals
(calibrated redirection rate + 95% CI, the benign-FPR control, the EAI risks covered, the
calibration metadata) onto **EU AI Act** (Art. 9 / 15 / 72), **ISO 10218-1/-2:2025** (cyber),
**NIST AI 100-2 / AI RMF**, and **IEC 62443**:

```bash
uv run provael report --in runs/calib --format compliance --out report.compliance.json  # evidence JSON
uv run provael report --in runs/calib --format compliance --out report.compliance.md    # auditor-readable
```

Each mapped requirement carries the Provael artifacts that evidence it, an `evidence-present` /
`gap` status (with a reason — e.g. an uncalibrated run flags the metrics that need calibration as
gaps), and the honest-scope caveats. It reuses `report.json` (no attacks re-run) and is
**evidence, not certification** — see
[docs/compliance/index.md](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/docs/compliance/index.md) for the full
crosswalk and schema.

For an assessor-facing pack, `provael certify` emits an EU Machinery Regulation Annex I Part A (or
`--profile annex-iii`) conformity-assessment evidence dossier — per-family ASR with both intervals,
an honest per-family real-policy transfer statement, a residual-risk statement, a clause crosswalk,
and references to the ML-BOM + attestation — as OSCAL plus a single print-to-PDF HTML; it is
evidence input to a conformity assessment, not certification (see

### Signed attestation (`provael attest`)

`attest` wraps that **same** compliance evidence into a **tamper-evident, dated, offline-verifiable
bundle** — the artifact an auditor or insurer keeps on file. It binds the run with a SHA-256 digest,
stamps a UTC date + the crosswalk ruleset + the source commit, records a per-attack transfer-test
status, and wraps it in a DSSE-style envelope:

```bash
uv run provael attest --policy stub --suite stub --out runs/attest   # issue a bundle + public key
# Verification is FAIL-CLOSED. Integrity-only grades just the digest layer:
uv run provael attest --verify runs/attest/attestation.json --integrity-only
# Strict verification needs a trust store — a valid signature from an unknown key is UNTRUSTED:
uv run provael attest --verify runs/attest/attestation.json --trust-store trust.json
```

Verification names the exact property it establishes: an unsigned bundle, or a valid signature from
a key that is not in *your* trust store, is **never** reported as "verified" — integrity, signature
validity, and signer trust are distinct. The digest layer is standard-library and always on.
Cryptographic **Ed25519 signing** rides the optional `provael[attest]` extra (`--no-sign` gives a
digest-only bundle without it). It re-runs nothing and is **evidence, not certification** — see
[docs/attestation.md](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/docs/attestation.md).

`--profile <iso-10218-2|iec-62443|insurer>` embeds a **standards-aligned assurance view**: the per-EAI
ASR as **ISO 10218-2:2025** cyber-risk-assessment evidence routed to **IEC 62443 SL2**, or a
structured **assurance-report draft** (an evidence export for a qualified assessor, *not* an insurer
or conformity-assessment opinion) with the honest *which-families-transfer-on-the-real-model* table
(ASR + 95% Wilson CI + benign-FPR + the `evidence_state` ladder + `measured-real-transfer` vs
`stub-validated-scaffolding`), plus a
third-party cert-readiness cross-reference (NVIDIA Halos / UL 4600 / ISO 21448 / ISO/PAS 8800). A
worked example over the real SmolVLA×LIBERO run is committed at
[`results/smolvla_libero_object/attestation.insurer.json`](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/results/smolvla_libero_object/attestation.insurer.json).

```bash
uv run provael attest --run results/smolvla_libero_object --profile insurer --out runs/attest
```

> **Open-core.** The CLI, attacks, calibrated ASR, SARIF, the GitHub Action and local `attest`

## Open-core boundary (free vs a future operated service)

Provael is **open-core**. Everything needed to red-team a policy and produce evidence is free and
Apache-2.0 — a durable, dated commitment:
**[the open-core promise](docs/open-core-promise.md)** (we will never move a feature from free to paid).
The intended paid surface is a **future operated service**; the in-repo hosted server is an
**experimental reference**, not that service.

| Capability | Free (Apache-2.0) | Future operated service |
| --- | :---: | :---: |
| CLI, all attack families (incl. the `backdoor` EAI03 screen), ASR + 95% CI + benign control | ✅ | |
| `transfer-test`, SARIF, the GitHub Action, the Embodied AI Security Top 10 | ✅ | |
| Measured defenses (`--defense`), `provael mitigation`, the Action's `defense` input | ✅ | |
| `provael certify` incl. the `risk_reduction_measures` dossier section | ✅ | |
| **Local `attest`** (digest-bound; Ed25519-signed with *your* key, verified against *your* trust store) + the leaderboard | ✅ | |
| **Experimental** reference server (`provael serve`, `[hosted]` extra) — disabled by default; operator-key, **untrusted by default** | ✅ | |
| **Authenticated, trusted signing** (a KMS-backed key an assessor can trust) — [production requirements](docs/maintainers/hosted-production-requirements.md) | | ⏳ not built |
| **Assurance-report draft** at scale (a structured evidence export, **not** an insurer / Notified-Body opinion) | | ⏳ not built |

```bash
pip install 'provael[hosted]'
PROVAEL_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_HOSTED=1 provael serve   # experimental reference server (operator-key, untrusted)
```

The experimental endpoint is behind a **local feature flag** (`PROVAEL_HOSTED_LICENSE`) that is
**not** authentication and lives **only** on the reference server — it never touches the free core.
The assurance-report draft maps a `provael attest` bundle to the **EU Machinery Regulation
2023/1230** (applies **2027-01-20**), the **AI Act** Annex-I machinery route (applies
**2028-08-02**, deferred from a statutory **2027-08-02** by Regulation (EU) 2026/1744, the Digital
Omnibus, in force 27 Jul 2026), and **ISO 10218:2025** —
see
[docs/compliance/machinery-reg-2027.md](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/docs/compliance/machinery-reg-2027.md).
**Evidence, not certification.**

                                          ▼                               ▼
              scoring (ASR) → RunReport → report.json / report.md    defense-log.jsonl
                                          │
                                          ▼
                    mitigation report (pre/post ASR + Wilson CI + controls)
```

The **Defense** step is opt-in (`--defense`) and sits in the *deployment position* — after the
attack, before the policy — so what is measured is what an operator would actually install. It
never sees the policy, the scorer, or the danger predicate. An **action-side** measure runs at one
further point — after the policy commits to a command and after the non-finite-action rejection, so a
clamp cannot launder a NaN into a finite value and hide a diverged head — and before the suite
executes it. Its raw → canonical and raw → filtered trails go to a `defense-log.jsonl` sidecar and its
identity to the execution manifest: **nothing is added to `RunReport`**, so the attestation subject
digest is unmoved and attestations issued by earlier versions still verify.

- **`PolicyAdapter`** — `load()`, `act(observation, instruction) -> np.ndarray`.
- **`SuiteAdapter`** — `tasks()`, `reset(task, seed)`, `step(action)`, `is_unsafe(state)`.
- **`Attack`** — `perturb(instruction, observation) -> (instruction, observation)`.
- **`Defense`** — `apply(instruction, observation) -> (instruction, observation)` on the way in, and
  `filter_action(action, observation) -> action` on the way out; neither changes policy weights, and
  neither is given the policy, the suite or the danger predicate. `position` records which side a
  measure acts on, because a text pre-filter and an output clamp are different protective measures
  with different failure modes. `provael list-defenses`.
- **`verify-checkpoint`** — a supply-chain control run BEFORE a policy loads: pinned-digest match
  and a refusal to load pickle-format weights, both fail-closed. It emits a **verdict, not a rate**,
  and does not reduce attack success. See [docs/checkpoint-integrity.md](docs/checkpoint-integrity.md).
- **`runner`** — runs every `(task, attack, seed)` episode and aggregates.
- **ASR** — `successes / attempts`, with `by_attack` and `by_task` breakdowns.

**Determinism.** A `RunReport` embeds no wall-clock time or process-varying values, so the
same config + seed always produces a byte-identical `report.json`.

## Roadmap

- **v0.1.0** — Provael (rebrand of the harness): CPU core, 3 attack families, real
  SmolVLA × LIBERO path, leaderboard.
- **v0.3.0** — SARIF output (`provael report --format sarif`), a reusable GitHub Action
  (`provael/provael`) that gates CI on ASR, and the Embodied-AI Top-10 mapping (every attack
  tagged to an `EAIxx` risk).
- **v0.4.0** — **per-task predicate calibration** (`provael calibrate`): a calibrated
  redirection rate with a 95% CI and the benign FPR as its control.
- **v0.5.0** — a **compliance evidence report** (`provael report --format compliance`) and the
  **`action` family (EAI04)** — action-space-integrity attacks (`freeze` + `trajectory_hijack`),
  stub-validated, each a rate with a 95% CI against a benign-FPR control.
- **unreleased** — **model breadth** (π0/π0.5/π0-FAST/GR00T/OpenVLA + bring-your-own), a second CPU
  **spatial suite** (`reach`) + gated Meta-World, **`reproduce`** for published attacks, a
  **pre-deployment scorecard** + **OSCAL**/**AVID** exports, named **recipes**, an **examples
  gallery** + **docs site**, **integrations** (promptfoo/garak/PyRIT, multi-CI SARIF, MLOps,
  supply-chain), a **runtime firewall** defense demo, and a public-submission leaderboard. *(this
  branch)*
- **next** — optimized (gradient/search) attacks incl. real-model action-freeze (FreezeVLA); more
  suites (RoboCasa / CALVIN / SimplerEnv / the AI2 harness bridge). See the full
  [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).
- **defenses** — measured mitigations with pre/post ASR + CI: **instruction canonicalization**
  (input side) and **action envelope** (action side), two of six taxonomy rows. Four remain
  *specified and unproven* ([docs/defenses.md](docs/defenses.md)).

## Development

```bash
make check               # lint + type-check + tests, exactly what CI runs

# or the three separately:
uv run ruff check .              # lint
uv run mypy src scripts/action   # type-check (strict); scripts/action too, as CI does
uv run pytest -q                 # tests (CPU only; LeRobot tests skip unless gated)
```

## How to cite

GitHub renders [`CITATION.cff`](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/CITATION.cff) into a
"Cite this repository" button, which is the path most people will use. The BibTeX below is the
same metadata, for pasting straight into a `.bib` file:

```bibtex
@software{jain_provael_2026,
  author  = {Jain, Sattyam},
  title   = {Provael: red-teaming Vision-Language-Action robot policies in simulation},
  version = {0.39.3},
  year    = {2026},
  doi     = {10.5281/zenodo.21984184},
  url     = {https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.21984184},
  license = {Apache-2.0}
}
```

<!-- THE DOI ABOVE IS THE CONCEPT DOI, and that choice is the point. Zenodo minted two when the
v0.34.0 GitHub Release fired: 10.5281/zenodo.21984185 for that specific version, and
10.5281/zenodo.21984184 for the concept. The concept one always resolves to the newest archived
version, so an entry copied into someone's bibliography today keeps working after the next release
instead of pinning them to whatever happened to be current when they cited it.

This block previously carried no DOI at all, for a reason that still holds and is worth keeping in
view: a citation is copied once and lives in someone else's bibliography forever, so a DOI that
does not resolve fails in a reviewer's reference check rather than in ours. Both DOIs were
confirmed resolving (HTTP 200) before this line was written.

Archiving is PROSPECTIVE. The Zenodo integration was enabled at v0.34.0, so nothing from v0.5.0
through v0.33.2 is archived and no earlier tag can be cited this way. Keep the version field here
in step with `CITATION.cff`. -->
