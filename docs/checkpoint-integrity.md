# Checkpoint supply-chain integrity

A pre-load control for the CI gate: **are we about to load the weights we think we are, in a format
that is safe to load?**

!!! warning "This is not an attack-success rate, and it does not reduce one"
    Checkpoint integrity is a **supply-chain control**. It produces a **verdict**, not a rate. A
    checkpoint that passes every check on this page can still be driven off-task by a reworded
    instruction at exactly the rate the [ASR](measure-2-7.md) reports. The two travel in the same
    evidence pack because an assessor needs both — they are **not the same claim and must never be
    added together**. Nothing here may be reported as, aggregated into, or described as moving an
    ASR.

## Why

Provael's [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/SECURITY.md) documents
[**CVE-2026-25874**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-25874) — LeRobot unauthenticated
pickle-deserialization RCE (CVSS 9.8), affecting `lerobot` through `0.5.1`. The flaw is in LeRobot's
**async-inference `PolicyServer`**, which `pickle.loads` untrusted payloads over an unauthenticated
gRPC endpoint (TCP/50051).

**Provael never starts that PolicyServer or any gRPC endpoint** — it uses LeRobot only for
in-process policy loading and the LIBERO simulator, behind the `[lerobot]` extra and the
`PROVAEL_INTEGRATION=1` gate, so that specific code path is not reachable through Provael. The
upstream fix is LeRobot PR #3048, which replaces pickle with safetensors + JSON.

The *class* of risk is broader than the one CVE, though, and it does reach us: **loading a pickle
executes it.** Any tool that fetches a third-party checkpoint and loads it is running the
checkpoint author's code. Provael's own incident tracker names this risk publicly; until 0.27.0 the
reusable Action did not check for it.

## Where it maps

**EAI03 — Model & pipeline poisoning, backdoors & supply chain.** The mapping is in the title.

Deliberately **not** EAI07 (CPS, firmware, comms & teleoperation compromise), whose catalog entry
declares that area out of scope. That scoping is about **attacks Provael does not run**, and filing
a control there would imply this closes some of it. It does not. The PolicyServer RCE that motivates
this has an EAI07 flavour, but what the gate inspects is the **checkpoint artifact**, which is
EAI03.

Note EAI03 already ships attacks (the `backdoor` family screens objective-decoupled triggers). This
control sits *alongside* that, not inside it: the backdoor family produces a rate, this produces a
verdict.

## What it checks

| Check | Default | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Digest matches a pinned SHA-256 | **fail closed** | "We did not check" and "we checked and it matched" must not produce the same verdict |
| Refuses pickle-format weights | **fail closed** | Loading a pickle executes it |
| Prefers safetensors | advisory | Where both are present the checkpoint is loadable safely — load the safetensors and do not fall back |

The digest is computed over the checkpoint's weight files, **order- and layout-independent** (per-file
SHA-256, sorted, then hashed), so a pin taken once re-checks anywhere.

Both fail-closed behaviours have an **explicit opt-out**, matching how the rest of the gate handles
defaults (`fail-on-regression` defaults true). An opt-out is recorded in the evidence — never
silent.

## Use it

```bash
# Print the digest to pin (run once, against a checkpoint you trust)
provael verify-checkpoint --checkpoint HuggingFaceVLA/smolvla_libero \
    --path ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--HuggingFaceVLA--smolvla_libero \
    --no-require-digest

# Then pin it. A mismatch exits non-zero and the policy is never loaded.
provael verify-checkpoint --checkpoint HuggingFaceVLA/smolvla_libero \
    --path ~/.cache/... --digest <sha256> --out runs/gate
```

In the Action, the step runs **before** the policy is instantiated — the check is worthless after
the load:

```yaml
- uses: provael/provael@v0.40.0
  with:
    policy: smolvla
    suite: libero
    checkpoint-path: ~/.cache/huggingface/hub/models--HuggingFaceVLA--smolvla_libero
    checkpoint-digest: ${{ vars.SMOLVLA_LIBERO_DIGEST }}
    # require-checkpoint-digest: true    # default — omit it
    # allow-pickle-checkpoint: false     # default — omit it
```

## What lands in the evidence pack

`checkpoint-integrity.json` in the run directory, and a `checkpointIntegrity` block in the SARIF
run properties — **nested under its own key**, never flattened beside `adversarialAsr`, so nothing
in it can be read as a rate:

```json
{
  "verdict": "pass",
  "eaiId": "EAI03",
  "format": "safetensors",
  "digestSha256": "…",
  "digestMatch": true,
  "pickleAllowed": false,
  "note": "Supply-chain control, not an adversarial-robustness result. This verdict is not an attack-success rate and does not reduce one."
}
```

The `note` travels with the record so the distinction survives being pasted into a slide.

## Honest scope

- It verifies **bytes and format**, not the model's behaviour. A digest match tells you the weights
  are the ones you pinned; it says nothing about whether those weights are backdoored.
- Pinning a digest of a checkpoint you never audited pins *that* checkpoint, faithfully. Integrity
  is not provenance.
- `allow-pickle-checkpoint: true` **accepts** code execution from the checkpoint author. It does not
  make it safe, and the evidence says so.
- This is not a certificate and not a notified-body opinion — the same scope that applies to every
  other artifact Provael emits.
