# Prior art & honest credit

`provael` stands on a growing body of academic work on the safety of
LLM-/VLA-controlled robots. This file credits the work we build on and states
plainly **how we differ** — what is novel here (a small, reproducible, model-agnostic
ASR harness) and what is not (the attack ideas themselves, which come from the papers
below).

## The works we build on

### RoboPAIR — *Jailbreaking LLM-Controlled Robots*
Robey, Ravichandran, Kumar, Hassani, Pappas (2024). arXiv:[2410.13691](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13691) · [robopair.org](https://robopair.org/)

The first algorithm to jailbreak LLM-controlled robots, eliciting *harmful physical
actions* (not just harmful text) by adapting the PAIR attacker-LLM loop and
fictional/role-play framings to the robotics setting.

**How we differ:** our `RolePlayAttack` is a single, fixed, human-readable template
inspired by RoboPAIR's fictional-framing idea — not RoboPAIR's optimizer. We ship a
reproducible measurement harness, not an attacker-LLM search loop. An optimizer-based
family is explicitly future work (see CHANGELOG v0.2).

### RoboGCG — *Adversarial Attacks on Robotic Vision Language Action Models*
Jones, Robey, Zou, Ravichandran, Pappas, Hassani, Fredrikson, Kolter (2025). arXiv:[2506.03350](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03350) · [code](https://github.com/eliotjones1/robogcg)

The successor to RoboPAIR from an overlapping group, and the closest published work to this
project's own threat model. It adapts LLM jailbreaking attacks "to obtain complete control
authority over VLAs", and reports that textual attacks "applied once at the beginning of a
rollout" achieve "full reachability of the action space of commonly used VLAs" and "often
persist over longer horizons". Its sharpest finding is a departure from the LLM jailbreaking
literature, in the authors' own words: "attacks in the real world do not have to be
semantically linked to notions of harm."

**How we differ:** they run a search to obtain control authority; our shipped `instruction`
family is a set of fixed, human-readable templates, and our one optimizing instruction family,
`optimized_instruction`, is a black-box, query-budgeted search over a command-preserving edit
space rather than an attack on the model's parameters. They demonstrate a capability; we
measure a rate, with a benign control and an interval.

**What we take from them:** the finding that a *single* rollout-initial text edit persists over
a horizon is the reason our instruction attacks are applied once and then scored across the
whole episode rather than re-applied per step. Their harm-decoupling observation is more
pointed still: it is the premise our `misalignment` family exists to test, and we had no
citation for it until now.

### POEX — *Towards Policy Executable Jailbreak Attacks Against LLM-based Robots*
(2024). arXiv:[2412.16633](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16633)

Shows that a *harmful text output ≠ a harmful executable policy*: it injects harmful
instructions plus optimized suffixes into the planning module so the resulting policy
is actually executable, evaluated on Harmful-RLbench (136 harmful instructions) on a
real arm and in simulation. Proposes safety-constrained prompts and pre-/post-planning
checks as defenses.

**How we differ:** we adopt POEX's central insight — *score success by whether the
policy reaches an unsafe state, not by what the model says* — as the core of our ASR
metric (`SuiteAdapter.is_unsafe`). Our `GoalSubstitutionAttack` is a templated
goal-hijack; POEX's optimized executable suffixes are a planned family, not shipped in
Part 1.

### BadVLA — *Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models via Objective-Decoupled Optimization*
Zhou, Tie, et al. (2025). arXiv:[2505.16640](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16640) · NeurIPS 2025 poster · [project page](https://badvla-project.github.io/)

The first systematic study of *backdoor* vulnerabilities in VLA models: a
training-/fine-tuning-time trigger that causes conditional control deviations with
near-100% attack success and little clean-task degradation.

**How we differ:** BadVLA is a **training-time** threat (it modifies the model);
`provael` is strictly **inference-time, black-box** red-teaming of an *unmodified*
policy. We never train, fine-tune, or poison weights. (Our `StubPolicy`'s trigger
lexicon is a *test fixture* that imitates a vulnerability so the CPU pipeline yields a
measurable ASR — it is not a model and not a backdoor.)

### FreezeVLA — *Action-Freezing Attacks against Vision-Language-Action Models*
Wong, et al. (2025). arXiv:[2509.19870](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19870) · [code](https://github.com/xinwong/FreezeVLA) (MIT)

An **optimised, white-box** visual attack: a min-max bi-level optimisation crafts an adversarial
image that makes the VLA *freeze* (emit null/stalled actions), an availability failure, at a reported
~76% average success rate.

**How we differ:** our `optimized_patch` family (`patch_hijack`) is the **inference-time, black-box
query** analogue — it searches over patch placements on the real camera frame, scoring each by the
policy's *emitted motion* via an oracle, and records `attacker_access="black-box-query"` (never
claiming the white-box-gradient access it does not use). We **reimplement the idea, porting no code**;
FreezeVLA's MIT license would permit a port with attribution, but a from-scratch predicate keeps the
core dependency-free. A true white-box-gradient variant and an availability/freeze success predicate
are noted as GPU/P1 follow-ups (see ROADMAP P0.3b). Like our other families, the transfer number is
GPU-gated and unclaimed until the `PROVAEL_INTEGRATION=1` path is run.

### Trajectory-Level Redirection — *Trajectory-Level Redirection Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models*
Puthumanaillam, Dongre, Thangeda, Nayyeri, Hakkani-Tür et al. (2026) — UIUC.
arXiv:[2606.12978](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.12978)v2 · [project page](https://vla-redirection-attack.github.io/)

Formalizes **command-preserving trajectory redirection**: a prompt-only threat model in which the
attacker picks one prompt before the episode (all policy/environment components fixed), and the prompt
must stay close to the benign instruction *while omitting target words and correction language*. It
introduces an **on-policy prompt search** that uses rollouts to discover perturbations whose
closed-loop behaviour tracks an attacker target under those command-preserving constraints, shown in
simulation and on hardware.

**This is the closest work to ours in this file, and it beats us on nearly every axis.** Same threat
class, overlapping models (SmolVLA, π₀.₅), same suite (LIBERO). Verified from their Table 1:
**7 of 9 architectures exceed 90% ASR** — OpenVLA 91.8%, SmolVLA 94.7%, π₀.₅ 97.5%, GR00T-N1 96.8%;
the two below are Octo (88.6%) and VLA-0 (82.8%) — and averaging the edit column gives **≈3.4 character
edits per successful attack**.

The constraint is the contribution. An unconstrained prompt reading "go to the other bin" is not an
attack, it is an instruction. Theirs has to still look like the original task.

**Where provael is weaker, which is most of the comparison:**

- **Breadth** — nine architectures against our one measured policy; our other seven backends are
  stub-validated with no real-model transfer claimed.
- **Hardware** — they run SO-100 hardware. `results/hardware/` reads **0**.
- **Threat-model rigour** — our `roleplay` carries no near-benign constraint and no edit budget. Their
  3.4-character figure bounds how far the attacker had to move; we do not measure distance from the
  benign instruction at all, so we cannot make a claim of that shape.
- **Search** — they search on-policy with rollouts; our instruction family is a fixed hand-written bank.

What we carry that they do not is a matched benign control at the same `(task, seed)` with a reported
false-positive rate, so our number is a lift over a baseline rather than a bare success count. That is
an engineering property, not a scientific one, and it does not offset the above.

**mapping_status: `cited, not crosswalked`.**

### SABER — *A Stealthy Agentic Black-Box Attack Framework for Vision-Language-Action Models*
Wu, Shi, Wang, Li, Bedi, Manocha (2026). arXiv:[2603.24935](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.24935) · [code](https://github.com/wuxiyang1996/SABER)

A black-box, agent-driven attacker that generates small, plausible **instruction edits** — character-,
token-, and prompt-level — under a **bounded edit budget** to induce targeted behavioural degradation,
probing the robustness of the *instruction channel* across VLA models.

**How we differ:** our `optimized_instruction` family (`targeted_redirect`) is a compact,
**reproducible reimplementation of the idea** — an on-policy, bounded-budget **greedy** instruction
search with a command-preserving gate (benign-similarity floor + omit target words), scored by the
policy's emitted redirection via an oracle and recording `attacker_access="black-box-query"`. We
**port no code**: the greedy loop and the gate are from-scratch and dependency-free (SABER's
GRPO/ReAct attacker and the paper's full search are not reimplemented). Consistent with our other
families, the **real** SmolVLA×LIBERO redirection number is GPU-gated (`PROVAEL_INTEGRATION=1`) and
unclaimed until run; on the CPU stub it is scored by the danger-threshold predicate with an honest
sub-100% ceiling, plus a held-out transfer-test. We surface the papers' recommended defense —
**instruction canonicalization / repair** — as the mitigation. No "first" claim.

### AttackVLA — *Benchmarking Adversarial and Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models*
(2025). arXiv:[2511.12149](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12149)

**The closest work to this repository, and the one that most constrains what we may claim.** A
**unified evaluation framework** for adversarial and backdoor attacks on VLAs: it implements
existing VLA attacks plus attacks adapted from vision-language models, evaluates them in **both
simulation and real-world robotic settings**, and reports attack success rates (58.4% average for
targeted attacks, reaching 100% on some tasks). It also introduces *BackdoorVLA*, a targeted
backdoor forcing an attacker-specified multi-step action sequence. Its stated gap: "current methods
tend to induce untargeted failures or static action states, leaving targeted attacks that drive VLAs
to perform precise long-horizon action sequences largely unexplored."

**How we differ — and where we do not.** Being honest here matters more than sounding novel:
AttackVLA **already occupies** the "one harness, many attacks, comparable ASR" position, and it
does so with **real-robot evaluation we do not have**. We do not claim to have originated a unified
VLA attack harness, and we do not claim parity with a benchmark that has been run on hardware. What
remains genuinely different is narrower and worth stating exactly: a **deterministic CPU-only,
no-download core** so every number is reproducible without a GPU or model weights, and an
**evidence/compliance layer** (SARIF, OSCAL, CycloneDX ML-BOM, signed attestation, a Wilson-CI
regression gate wired into CI) — engineering a research benchmark has no reason to build. See
"What is actually novel here" below, which was rewritten after reading this paper.

### UPA-RFAS — *When Robots Obey the Patch: Universal Transferable Patch Attacks on VLA Models*
(2025). arXiv:[2511.21192](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21192) · CVPR 2026

Learns a **single universal physical patch** in a shared feature space and reports transfer across
unknown architectures, finetuned variants, tasks, viewpoints and **sim-to-real shifts**. The method
is white-box and feature-space: an ℓ1 deviation prior plus a repulsive InfoNCE loss, a two-phase
min-max robustness loop (inner: sample-wise invisible perturbations; outer: the universal patch
against that hardened neighbourhood), and two VLA-specific losses — *Patch Attention Dominance*
(hijack text→vision attention) and *Patch Semantic Misalignment* (label-free image-text mismatch).

**How we differ:** our `universal_patch` family reimplements the **threat model, not the method**,
and ports no code. What is shared is the question — does *one frozen patch* keep working on episodes
and tasks it never queried, which is the constraint a printed sticker actually faces and which our
per-episode `optimized_patch` family deliberately does not model. What is **not** shared is how the
patch is found: ours is an inference-time **black-box query** search over placements (the access
class it records), with no gradients, no feature-space access, no InfoNCE and no attention
objective. It will therefore find a **weaker** patch than UPA-RFAS reports, and our numbers must
never be read as reproducing theirs. Consistent with our other image-channel families the real
transfer rate is GPU-gated (`PROVAEL_INTEGRATION=1`) and **unclaimed** until run. Critically, the
paper's sim-to-real component is **theirs, not ours** — we have no hardware result of any kind.

### ADVLA — *Attention-Guided Patch-Wise Sparse Adversarial Attacks on VLA Models*
(2025). arXiv:[2511.21663](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21663)

Applies perturbations directly to features projected from the visual encoder into the *textual*
feature space, using attention guidance to keep them focused and sparse. Reports that under an
L∞ = 4/255 constraint, ADVLA with Top-K masking modifies **under 10% of patches** while reaching
near-100% attack success — without the costly end-to-end training or conspicuous patches earlier
methods needed.

**How we differ:** ADVLA is a **white-box** attack requiring encoder-internal feature access. Every
image-channel family we ship is **black-box query** only, so we cannot and do not reproduce its
imperceptibility or its success rate. It is recorded here because it sets the bar for what a
gradient-based variant would need to reach, and because a reader comparing our sub-100% patch
numbers to the literature deserves to know a far stronger white-box attack exists.

### SafeVLA — *Towards Safety Alignment of Vision-Language-Action Models via Constrained Learning*
(2025). arXiv:[2503.03480](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03480) · [safevla.github.io](https://safevla.github.io/)

A **defense**: aligns VLA policies with safe reinforcement learning (a constrained
MDP / min-max formulation), reporting large safety improvements with maintained task
performance and sim-to-real transfer.

**How we differ (complementary):** SafeVLA hardens policies; `provael` measures how
often a policy can still be driven unsafe. The two are two sides of the same coin — a
defense like SafeVLA is exactly the kind of policy whose residual ASR our harness is
meant to quantify.

### Mostly Harmless VLA Steering — *Learning What to Say to Your VLA*
Jeong, Swamy, Bajcsy (2026). arXiv:[2606.12299](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.12299)

The benign twin of our `instruction` family, opening from the same premise almost verbatim:
"the mapping from language to behavior is often brittle and unintuitive: semantically similar
instructions can induce drastically different behaviors." They interactively search language
space to *improve* closed-loop task performance, distil the result into a test-time language
feedback policy, and conformalize an improvement head so steering is withheld where it would
hurt. On seen environments they report improving base VLA performance by 24.7% in simulation
and 65.0% in hardware — on arbitrary frozen pre-trained VLAs, with no access to the training
distribution and no fine-tuning.

**How we differ:** they search language space to improve behaviour; we search it to break it.
Same space, opposite objective. The symmetry is the point rather than a coincidence: both
projects exist because language-to-behaviour is unstable, and that instability is a capability
to them and an attack surface to us.

**What we take from them:** the strongest available statement that a VLA's sensitivity to
phrasing is a *property of the model* rather than an artefact of adversarial search. That is an
assumption our instruction family rests on and, until this paper, could not cite.

**An open question — addressed to the authors, not offered as a criticism.** Their guarantee
(Eq. 7) bounds a false-positive rate conditional on steering being harmful,
`P(ψ(X) ≥ q̂α | Y = 0) ≤ α`, under the standard conformal exchangeability assumption between
calibration and deployment examples. The calibration set is built from held-out perturbations
that "paraphrase the verb, noun, and a mix of both", generated by a language model — sampled,
not optimised against the policy under test. Our `optimized_instruction` family searches that
same space adversarially, under a query budget. An adversarially optimised perturbation is not
exchangeable with a randomly paraphrased one by construction, so what a conformalized
harmlessness guarantee covers under that shift is genuinely unclear. It may hold, it may
degrade gracefully, or the coverage statement may simply not apply outside its calibration
distribution. **We have not tested this and make no claim about the answer** — we raise it
because it is the question our harness is shaped to ask and theirs is shaped to answer.

### SARF and AGSD — *Structure-Aware Robust Fine-Tuning: Defending Vision-Language-Action Robots Against Physical Attention Hijacking*
Zhang, Yin, Yang, Yan, Tian, Yu (2026). arXiv:[2608.03231](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.03231) · submitted 4 August 2026

Both halves of the loop in one paper. The attack, **AGSD** (Attention-Guided Semantic Disruption),
is an Expectation-over-Transformation-optimised printable patch that "jointly (i) concentrates
action-to-vision attention on the patch and (ii) disrupts vision-language semantic alignment", which
the authors frame as triggering "policy-critical action-to-vision attention hijacking". The defense,
**SARF**, is "a zero-inference-overhead defense that fine-tunes only the visual encoder using
feature anchoring, policy-critical attention correction, and language-guided geometric consistency
restricted to semantically relevant regions". Their headline: **"On LIBERO, SARF reduces OpenVLA's
failure rate under AGSD from 100% to 14.2%-56.8% (28.6% average) across suites while preserving
clean performance, and on a real PiPER manipulator it improves average success under AGSD from 23.0%
to 65.0%."**

**How we differ, and where we are simply behind:** our two shipped defenses
(`instruction_canonicalization`, `action_envelope`) are measured on a deterministic CPU fixture and
are labelled stub-validated scaffolding, with no real-model transfer claimed for either. SARF is
measured on a real model *and on real hardware*. **That comparison should not be softened: they have
a physical-robot defense number and we have none, on any hardware, for any family.** The
`/sim-to-real` protocol is pre-registered and its trials have not been run. Reporting a
mitigation is in our free tool because a mitigation you cannot measure is a marketing claim; that
principle does not earn us a result we have not produced.

**What we take from them:** AGSD's mechanism claim — that the patch works by *diverting
action-conditioned attention*, not merely by corrupting pixels — is a sharper account of what a
patch family is actually attacking than we had a citation for. It also bears on the RFC: attention
hijacking and first-step denoising redirection are two different mechanisms behind the same visual
delivery channel, which is the argument for naming mechanisms rather than channels.

### FLARE and ChromaGuard — *Lights, Camera, Malfunction: When Illumination Robustness Leaves VLA Models Blind to Color*
Watanabe, Sato, Yoshioka (2026). arXiv:[2607.14698](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.14698) · submitted 16 July 2026

A physical attack with no printed artifact at all. **FLARE** is "an optimized physical spotlight
attack framework that exploits these vulnerabilities via targeted illuminations, dropping baseline
task success rates to zero without any access to model internals" — so it is **black-box**, and its
delivery channel is light rather than a sticker. The more useful half of the paper is a defensive
trap: the authors "identify a critical and previously underestimated defensive pitfall: naive data
augmentations incorrectly condition VLA models to discard color as noise, collapsing their visual
perception into a purely shape-biased processor", exposed by a diagnostic grayscale evaluation in
which the defended model holds up on grayscale while "its success rate on benign, color-dependent
real-world tasks drops to at most 47.5%, well below the undefended baseline". Their **ChromaGuard**
chroma-preserving adversarial training reports "97.5% and 92.5% success rates in benign and attacked
color-dependent tasks" on a physical 6-DoF platform.

**How we differ:** we model no illumination channel. Every `visual`-family attack we ship perturbs
the observation tensor a policy receives, which is a printed-patch-shaped assumption; a spotlight is
a different physical primitive and we do not represent it. We also cannot run their diagnostic:
grayscale-vs-colour benign evaluation needs a real policy on real colour-dependent tasks, and our
benign control is a deterministic fixture.

**What we take from them, and it is uncomfortable:** their pitfall is a direct warning about the
shape of our own defense evidence. A defense that improves an attacked number while quietly
degrading benign capability is exactly what our `action_envelope` study calls a coverage question,
and their grayscale diagnostic is a cleaner instrument for catching it than the
benign-task-success acceptance gate we currently apply. We have not implemented an equivalent
diagnostic and do not claim one.

### World-Model Security Survey — *Security of World-Model-Based Embodied AI: A Lifecycle of Threats, Defenses, and Evaluation*
Liu, Chen, Tan, Meng, Chen, Zhu (2026). arXiv:[2607.28226](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.28226) · submitted 30 July 2026

**A different indexing axis, and that is the whole value.** Every taxonomy in this file — including
our own Embodied AI Security Top 10 — indexes by **attack channel**: what the adversary touches, be
it the instruction, the pixels, the sensor stream, the action head. This survey indexes by **which
world-model property gets corrupted**. It takes the seven familiar families (poisoning, backdoors,
adversarial examples, sensor spoofing, prompt injection, trajectory manipulation, supply-chain) and
argues they "take on distinct meanings when they corrupt world states, learned dynamics, affordance
estimates, or safety costs".

Those two axes cross; they do not merge. A prompt injection and a sensor spoof are different
channels that can corrupt the same learned dynamics, and one channel can corrupt several properties.
Collapsing either axis into the other loses the thing that made it worth drawing.

**The claim with no counterpart in EAI01–EAI10.** Their duality: world models "can serve as runtime
safety shields, yet when compromised or over-trusted they generate predictive safety illusions". Our
Top 10 has no entry for *the safety mechanism itself becoming the attack surface by being believed*.
That is a real gap on our side, not a difference in scope, and it is the single most useful thing to
take from this paper.

**mapping_status: `not-crosswalked`.** Deliberately, and the reason is measurable rather than
editorial. Verified against the full 18-page PDF this run: **zero** occurrences of `github.com`,
`https://`, "code is available" or "we release" — there is no runnable harness to point at — and
**no reported denominator anywhere**: no `n = N`, no `x/y trials`, no benign control arm. There is
nothing yet that a number of ours could be compared against, so a crosswalk would be prose mapped
onto prose, which is the kind of table that reads as coverage without carrying any.

**Their proposed metric is sharper than "they have no ASR", though, and we should say so.** The
phrase "attack success rate" appears exactly once in the paper, and it appears in order to argue
past it: "The primary metric is not only attack success rate, but the rate of predicted-safe but
actually unsafe executions, together with monitor confidence and intervention recall." That is a
better-specified quantity than the one we report — it measures the safety monitor's failure, not
just the attack's success — and we do not measure it. It is outlined, not operationalized; if they
build that side out, it is the row we should map to first.

**How we differ:** we are a runnable harness with a denominator and no lifecycle theory; this is a
lifecycle theory with no denominator. That is a complementarity, not a competition, and it is the
argument for crossing the two axes once rather than five times.

### SafeVLA-Bench — *A Benchmark for the Success-Safety Gap in Vision-Language-Action Models*
Fan, Xu, Sokolsky, Lee, Kong (2026) — University of Notre Dame and University of Pennsylvania.
arXiv:[2606.00773](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.00773) · submitted 30 May 2026 · [safevla.org](https://safevla.org)

**Not the SafeVLA entry above.** Two different works, two years apart, with near-identical names:
[SafeVLA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03480) (2025) is a *defense* that aligns policies via
constrained learning; SafeVLA-**Bench** (2026) is an *evaluation framework* that scores existing
rollouts. Cited separately because conflating them would attribute a benchmark's metrics to an
alignment method.

**We already use their vocabulary, which is the reason this entry is overdue.**
`provael.scoring.asr.succ_but_unsafe` implements a Succ-But-Unsafe rate and names SafeVLA-Bench in
its own docstring; `RunReport.succ_but_unsafe` carries it into every report. Borrowing a metric name
without citing its source in prior art is exactly the omission this file exists to prevent.

**The relationship, precisely: different failures on the same policies.** They formalize "task-aware
safety requirements as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications and report native success with two
unsafe-success metrics: Succ-But-Unsafe (SBU) ... and Violation Severity Index (VSI)". Both metrics
are **post-hoc and non-adversarial** — they score rollouts a policy produced *on its own*, under the
benchmark's ordinary instructions, and ask whether success concealed a violation. Provael's ASR is
**pre-hoc and adversarial** — it perturbs the input first and asks whether an attacker can *cause* a
violation.

So the questions do not overlap even where the machinery looks similar:

| | SafeVLA-Bench | `provael` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| When it acts | after the rollout (post-hoc scoring) | before it (input perturbation) |
| Who causes the failure | nobody — the policy's own behaviour | an adversary, by construction |
| Safety definition | STL specifications over the trajectory | a keep-out predicate, currently **uncalibrated** |
| Denominator | rollouts of the native benchmark task | matched (task, seed) pairs against a benign twin |

**Both instantiate on LIBERO**, which is what makes a future crosswalk tractable rather than
hypothetical: they evaluate nine policy-benchmark entries across LIBERO and RoboCasa-365, and our
one measured real-policy result is SmolVLA × `libero_object`. That is a shared substrate, not a
shared metric.

**Their finding is the one that should worry a reader of our numbers most**, and it is independent
of anything we measured: "high-SR tabletop baselines still leave 13 to 15 percent unsafe-episode
rates, and 36 to 56 percent of successful RoboCasa-365 rollouts violate at least one active safety
clause." A policy can be *unattacked* and still unsafe at those rates. Our ASR says nothing about
that floor — it measures lift over a benign control, so a policy that is already unsafe 15% of the
time without any adversary is invisible to us by construction.

**And our benign arm is not a smaller version of their number.** It is tempting to read our
5/100 (5.0%, Wilson 95% [2.2%, 11.2%]) benign firing rate as a Provael-side estimate of the same
unattacked-unsafety floor they put at 13–15%, and lower. It is not, and the two must not be placed
side by side. `studies/keepout_calibration/` shows every one of those five firings landing on two
of ten tasks, across two independent runs with different seeds, with the other eight silent through
80 benign episodes — so the rate is dominated by where the default keep-out box was put, not by how
often SmolVLA is unsafe unattacked. Their 13–15% is a measurement of a policy; ours is, on this
evidence, largely a measurement of an instrument. Until the predicate is calibrated we have no
comparable estimate of that floor at all, which is a stronger statement than "ours is lower".

**mapping_status: `aspirational`.** We have not implemented this crosswalk and are not claiming one.
Our `succ_but_unsafe` shares their *name* and their per-episode quadrant logic, but not their units:
theirs is an STL-violation judgement over a trajectory, ours is a boolean from an uncalibrated
keep-out predicate. Placing the two in one column would repeat the mistake the ForesightSafety-VLA
crosswalk exists to avoid — borrowing vocabulary is not borrowing units. Calibrating our predicate
is the prerequisite, and it is not done.

**How we differ (complementary):** they measure whether success hides a violation; we measure
whether an adversary can induce one. A policy that scores well on SBU can still have a high ASR, and
a policy with a low ASR can still be routinely unsafe on its own. Neither number substitutes for the
other, and a safety case that cites only one is answering half the question.

### Embodied AI Safety Survey — *Safety in Embodied AI: A Survey of Risks, Attacks, and Defenses*

companion list [x-zheng16/Awesome-Embodied-AI-Safety](https://github.com/x-zheng16/Awesome-Embodied-AI-Safety)

**The most complete map of this field we know of, and it is maintained rather than published-once.**
The companion list organises the literature into five taxonomy layers with a daily LLM-screened
arXiv feed behind it, split into an explicitly-marked auto-screened tier and a human-reviewed
Editor's Audit before anything is promoted into the curated survey. That two-tier design is the
same distinction this project draws between `stub-validated` and measured, applied to a reading
list, and it is unusual enough to be worth naming.

**mapping_status: `cited, not crosswalked`.** We have not mapped the Embodied AI Security Top 10
category-by-category onto this survey's taxonomy, and until that exists we claim no coverage parity
with it. Saying so is cheaper than a table that implies the mapping was done.

**Their Open Challenges name the gap this tool was built for**, verified in the list README this
run: "Benchmark Standardization: Lack of unified safety benchmarks across the full embodied AI
pipeline hinders reproducible evaluation." A catalogue of several hundred papers containing, as far
as we can tell, no runnable harness is itself evidence for that sentence.

**Verified this run, because two details are easy to get wrong.** The licence on the companion list
is **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** — NonCommercial, not the plain CC BY it is sometimes described as, which
matters to anyone planning to reuse it. And **Xiang Zheng, who maintains the list, is the second
author of the survey**; the first is Xiao Li. Cite it as Li, Zheng et al., not Zheng et al.

We did not verify a total paper count. Per-layer headings in the list README show Perception at 199
and Action and Interaction at 112 across five layers; our own crude count of markdown entries is
~570. Any single headline number for this list should be taken from the list, not from us.

### RoboJailBench — *Benchmarking Adversarial Attacks and Defenses in Embodied Robotic Agents*
Yeke, Zhou, Lin, Cai, Bianchi, Celik (2026) — Purdue PurSec.
arXiv:[2605.19328](https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.19328)v1 · [leaderboard](https://purseclab.github.io/benchmark-for-robotics-security/)

**Already crosswalked in depth — see [`docs/crosswalk/robojailbench.md`](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/docs/crosswalk/robojailbench.md)**,
which quotes all 18 security-violation consequence categories verbatim from their Table 2 and maps them
against the Embodied AI Security Top 10. This entry does not repeat that. It records the one thing the
crosswalk does not say.

**Their motivating gap is the problem our benign control solves, and they reached it independently.**
They fault prior work for relying on "ad-hoc datasets, limited metrics" and for emphasising "attack
success while neglecting the trade-off between security and the ability to follow benign commands",
answering it with an intent-contrast dataset pipeline that pairs adversarial and benign goals. That is
**convergent, not derivative** — their pairing and our benign-FPR arm were designed separately and land
on the same conclusion: an attack-success rate without a benign twin is uninterpretable.

Verified: conceptual deception reaches **94–100% ASR** across RoboVQA, RH20T, NVIDIA PhysicalAI-AV and
RJB-Instructions in the no-defense setting.

**The honest difference in what is under test.** They evaluate **VLM planners** — models that read a
scene and emit a plan. Provael evaluates **closed-loop low-level policies** emitting motor commands
every step. A jailbroken planner has produced a bad sentence; a redirected policy has already moved.
Neither number transfers to the other, and a reader comparing the two ASRs is comparing different
quantities.

**Where provael is weaker:** they ship an evolving public repository with standardised metrics, four
integrated attacks, two defenses and an external leaderboard. Ours has **zero third-party
submissions**.

### Altered Thoughts, Altered Actions — *Probing Chain-of-Thought Vulnerabilities in VLA Manipulation*
Trinh, Akhtar, Azam (2026) — University of Melbourne.
arXiv:[2603.12717](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.12717)v1

**They attack a channel provael cannot reach.** A reasoning VLA emits a natural-language plan before
decoding motor commands; they corrupt that intermediate trace with all inputs left intact. Provael
perturbs the instruction and never touches the reasoning trace, so our harness has no attack for this
vector at all.

Verified from the abstract: substituting **object names** in the reasoning trace costs **8.3 pp**
overall, reaching **−19.3 pp** on goal-conditioned tasks and **−45 pp** on individual tasks — while
sentence reordering, spatial-direction reversal, token noise, and a 70B-parameter LLM crafting
plausible-but-wrong plans all land **within ±4 pp**.

Their conclusion: "the action decoder depends on entity-reference integrity rather than reasoning
quality or sequential structure", and "a sophisticated LLM-based attacker underperforms simple
mechanical object-name substitution, because preserving plausibility inadvertently retains the
entity-grounding structure the decoder needs."

**Where provael is weaker:** 40 LIBERO tasks against our 10, a cross-architecture control against a
non-reasoning VLA, and seven corruptions across three attacker tiers. We have one instruction family
and no reasoning-trace attack. Their result also implies an entire attack surface — the internal text
channel — that our threat model does not enumerate.

Their result has the same shape as
[our semantic-versus-mechanical finding](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/docs/findings/semantic-vs-mechanical-instruction-attacks.md)
seen from the other side: what matters is *which entity is referred to*, not how the sentence is built.
Ours is the adversarial framing of the same contrast — a fixed safety envelope with a benign control,
so the quantity is an envelope-exit rate rather than a task-success delta.

### Q-DIG — *Red-Teaming Vision-Language-Action Models via Quality Diversity Prompt Generation*

arXiv:[2603.12510](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.12510)v3 · [qdigvla.github.io](https://qdigvla.github.io)

**They generate the adversarial instructions; we hand-write ours.** Q-DIG applies quality-diversity
optimisation with a VLM in the loop to find diverse, natural, task-relevant instructions that induce
failures. Verified from their tables: the base VLA succeeds on **37.0%** of unseen adversarial
instructions against **97.4%** on the original phrasing (OpenVLA-OFT in SimplerEnv); fine-tuning on
generated instructions lifts that to 52.2–60.5%.

**This is the sharpest methodological criticism of provael in this file.** Our instruction attacks are
a fixed bank — `benign_reword` holds **four** templates, chosen by a maintainer. A fixed bank measures
the templates it contains and generalises no further. Q-DIG searches the space and reports coverage of
it, and a user study judged its prompts more natural than baselines. When our reword arm returns
near-zero, Q-DIG is the reason that must be read as *"these four rewrites do not fire"* rather than
*"rewording is safe"*.

**Where provael is weaker:** search versus enumeration; a prompt-naturalness user study we have not
run; multiple simulation benchmarks against our one; and real-world evaluation consistent with sim.
They also close the loop — fine-tuning on found prompts improves robustness — where provael measures
and never mitigates.

### VLA Safety Survey — *Vision-Language-Action Safety: Threats, Challenges, Evaluations, and Mechanisms*

[github.com/LiQiiiii/Awesome-VLA-Safety](https://github.com/LiQiiiii/Awesome-VLA-Safety)

Organised along two timing axes — attack timing and defense timing, training-time versus inference-time
— which is a cleaner cut than our channel-based Top 10 for one specific purpose: it encodes *at which
stage a threat can be mitigated*, which our taxonomy does not record at all.

**Their fifth open problem is standardised evaluation**, listed with certified robustness for embodied
trajectories, physically realizable defenses, safety-aware training, and unified runtime safety
architectures. That is the problem provael exists to address, which makes this the clearest external
statement of why the tool should exist — and equally the clearest measure of how far one maintainer-run
result falls short of it.

**Where provael is weaker:** it is a survey, so comparing measurement counts is meaningless. The real
gap is elsewhere — they maintain a **living index of the field and provael is not in it**. A tool
arguing for standardised evaluation that is absent from the field's own index has an adoption problem,
not a taxonomy problem.

### !Imperio, smolVLA — *The Implications of Data Poisoning on Open Source Robotics*
Bühler, Schutera (2026) — DHBW.
arXiv:[2607.04146](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.04146)v1

**Orthogonal rather than competing, and on our exact stack.** A training-time attack: poison a handful
of demonstration episodes with a trigger word and the model carries a backdoor. Provael is an
inference-time harness with no training-time attack, so nothing here overlaps our measurements.

Verified from the abstract: **three poisoned episodes in 320 clean episodes** suffice for complete
denial of service — success drops to **0.0 ± 0.0%** across all trigger-word conditions while the robot
locks into a fixed joint configuration — and **clean-prompt behaviour holds at ≈50%**, so the attack is
stealthy under normal operation. A **single** poisoned episode already drops success to 6.7 ± 6.7%.

Same policy as our one measured result (SmolVLA) and the same ecosystem (LeRobot), which makes it
directly relevant rather than adjacent. **An integrator running provael against a poisoned checkpoint
would see a clean benign control and an unremarkable ASR**, because the backdoor only fires on the
trigger. Our harness cannot detect this class: `provael verify-checkpoint` addresses supply-chain
integrity of the *artifact*, not semantic integrity of its *training data*.

**Where provael is weaker:** they run real hardware — an SO-101 arm from the
[SO-ARM100](https://github.com/TheRobotStudio/SO-ARM100) project — and we run none. That is the same
platform our own SO-101 sim-to-real study is **pre-registered against and has not executed**, so they
hold working hardware evidence on the platform we have only planned for.

**mapping_status: `cited, not crosswalked`.** No crosswalk is possible: a training-time backdoor rate
and an inference-time ASR share no denominator.

### DURA — *Hidden in Plain Sight: Diffusion-Based Unrestricted Robotic Attacks on VLA Models*
Han, Yao, Wang, Cao, Zhang, Shan, Deng, Wang, Hu (2026).
arXiv:[2608.10393](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.10393) · submitted 11 August 2026

**The strongest published attack on the channel where provael measures a null**, and the entry that
should change how that null is read.

DURA generates visually natural adversarial patches by optimising along the latent trajectory of a
pretrained diffusion model, in both white-box and black-box settings — the black-box variant needing
only the victim's *predicted actions*. Verified from their Table 1 (OpenVLA-7B, four LIBERO suites),
reading DURA's own `Ours` rows rather than a neighbouring baseline's:

| setting | simulated patch | physical patch |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| White-box, target-only | **100.0%** on all four suites | **100.0%** on all four suites |
| Black-box, target-only | **86.0%** avg | **79.3%** avg |
| Benign (no patch) | 23.5% | 23.5% |
| Clean patch (non-adversarial) | 39.5% | 39.5% |

The white-box 100% sits in the **target-only** group — no ground-truth action tokens — which is the
harder supervision setting, not the easier one. A label-supervised baseline (UADA) also reads 100.0
across that table; attributing it to DURA would be the obvious misreading and is worth naming.

Their patch-area ablation: ASR "rises sharply to 77% at only 2% area", reaches "99%" at 5%, and
saturates at 100% beyond (white-box, OpenVLA, mean over three seeds). Demonstrated on a real Franka
arm, with a **printed patch inserted into the camera view** — inserting it drives the arm to the
target action, removing it lets the arm resume.

Two further results, because they close the obvious escape routes:

- **Query budget.** Black-box ASR rises "from 49% at K=128 to 100% at K=2048". The black-box
  variant needs only the victim's predicted actions, so 2048 queries is the whole price of entry.
- **Input transformations.** Under the strongest JPEG compression (Q=10) ASR "remains 90% on
  OpenVLA and 100% on π₀-FAST", and "stays at 98–100% under bit-depth reduction and Gaussian
  noise". Sanitising the image does not remove the patch.

One number in that appendix is easy to misquote and worth pinning: their "clean baselines of 23%
and 14%" are the **Benign (no patch)** rows (Table 1 Avg 23.5, Table 2 Avg 14.5), *not* the
**Clean patch** rows (39.5 and 20.8). The two differ by roughly sixteen points and citing the
wrong one flatters their attack by a wide margin.

**How we differ, and where we are weaker — this is the useful part of the entry.**

Provael's `visual` family is **two attacks**, and neither is an image. `patch` appends the literal
string `adv_patch::{object}::now` to a list called `visual_tokens` in a simulated observation dict;
`decoy_object` appends `salient-decoy-first` alongside a planted object name. They are **symbolic
stand-ins for a perception attack**, evaluated in a simulator that never renders an adversarial
pixel. DURA optimises actual pixels, prints them, and holds them in front of a real camera.

That gap changes what our own null means. The ten-task suite measured `patch` at **0/50** and the
whole visual family at **0/100**, and it is tempting to read that as "perception attacks did not
transfer to SmolVLA". It does not support that reading. It supports a narrower one: *our symbolic
markers did not fire*.

**Say it without the hedge: our patch implementation is weak, and that is what the 0/50 measures.**
Not the attack class. The specific reason to believe that, rather than a general appeal to
modesty, is the optimisation: DURA searches the **latent space of a pretrained diffusion model**
for a perturbation that is simultaneously visually natural and action-steering, then renders it to
pixels. Ours performs no optimisation of any kind — `patch` appends a fixed literal string to a
list in a dict. There is no gradient, no search, no image and no renderer, so there is no
mechanism by which it *could* find the perturbation DURA finds. A method with no search space
returning zero is not evidence about a method with one.

DURA is the standing evidence that a real optimised patch on the same class of policy reaches 100%.
The honest gloss on our 0/50 and 0/100 is therefore a **coverage gap in our harness**, not a
robustness finding about the policy. Both nulls stay published exactly as measured.

We also have **zero physical results of any kind**: `results/hardware/` reads 0 and the SO-101
protocol is pre-registered and unrun. DURA's physical column is not a number we can currently
produce at any n.

What we carry that they do not is a matched benign control at the same `(task, seed)` and a reported
false-positive rate. Their table does carry benign and clean-patch baselines (23.5% and 39.5%), which
is the same instinct and more than most of this file's entries manage.

### DRIFT — *Derailing Denoising Trajectories of Flow-Matching VLAs with Adversarial Patch Attack*
Tae, Lee (2026).
arXiv:[2608.03207](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.03207) · submitted 4 August 2026

**The third entry in a row where a published patch attack beats ours, and the sharpest** — because
the obvious explanation for the gap is available, comfortable, and wrong.

DRIFT is a test-time **universal adversarial patch placed on the robot's gripper** that attacks the
denoising velocity field of an off-the-shelf flow-matching policy. Their framing of the prior state
is the part that matters here: flow-matching VLAs "have been reported to resist adversarial
perturbations that readily fool autoregressive VLAs", and they argue "this robustness is largely
illusory: it stems from prior attacks ignoring the multi-step denoising ODE". Their headline, from
the abstract: on π0 and π0.5 across four LIBERO suites, DRIFT "breaks essentially all
originally-solvable tasks with a small single patch, far exceeding action- and embedding-space
attack baselines". Their counterintuitive finding is that attacking **only the first denoising
step** is both stronger and cheaper than attacking a wider window.

Provael's `patch` measured **0/50** on SmolVLA × LIBERO, and the visual family **0/100**.

**The tempting resolution is an architecture difference, and this repo's own data refuses it.**
It would be convenient to say DRIFT attacks flow-matching policies while we measured something
else. We did not: `lerobot_adapter.py` declares `action_head_class = "flow"`, and every episode in
the pinned ten-task evidence records `flow`. SmolVLA **is** a flow-matching policy by this
project's own taxonomy. So DRIFT's target class and ours are the same class, and the architecture
explanation is unavailable.

What is left is the threat model and the optimisation, which is the same finding as
[DURA](#dura--hidden-in-plain-sight-diffusion-based-unrestricted-robotic-attacks-on-vla-models)
arriving by a different route:

- **DRIFT is white-box and gradient-optimised** against the denoising ODE of the policy under test,
  fitting a universal patch at test time.
- **Ours performs no search at all.** `patch` appends the literal string `adv_patch::{object}::now`
  to a `visual_tokens` list in a simulated observation dict. There is no gradient, no image, no
  renderer and no optimisation, so there is no mechanism by which it could find what DRIFT finds.

Three independent groups have now published optimised patch attacks that far exceed our null on
this channel. At that point the honest reading of 0/50 is not "the policy resisted" and not even
"our implementation is weak on this instance" — it is that **provael had no image-space patch
attack**, and the visual family's nulls measure the absence of one. That is a coverage gap in the
harness, stated as such. Both nulls stay published exactly as measured.

**Update, 1 September 2026 — the gap is half closed, and it is worth being exact about which
half.** `gradient_patch` (family `gradient_patch`, `attacker_access: white-box-gradient`) now ships:
untargeted L-inf projected gradient ascent on the feature the action head consumes, using the
policy's own input gradients. So the first clause above is no longer true — there IS an image-space
gradient attack in the harness.

The second clause still stands, and nothing here retires it. **The published 0/50 nulls were
measured with `patch`, and they remain exactly what they were**: the result of a string-append
fixture, not of this attack. `gradient_patch` has never run against SmolVLA × LIBERO, so no VLA
number is claimed, and `applicable()` keeps the arm out of the ASR denominator wherever the
gradient path is absent — a CPU run cannot report it as a null it never attempted.

What it HAS been measured on is a different policy and a different task: **Diffusion Policy ×
PushT**, n = 20 per condition on identical seeds. Task success went from 9/20 clean and **14/20
under random L-inf noise** to **0/20 under the optimised perturbation at the same eps = 0.10
budget** (exact McNemar vs the noise arm, p = 0.00012; mean target coverage 0.971 → 0.333). The
noise arm is the load-bearing control: it establishes that the damage comes from the optimisation
and not from the corruption, which is precisely the comparison the 0/50 nulls never made. Random
noise at that budget slightly *helped* the policy, so the attack had to beat a control that was
improving it.

That is evidence about the METHOD, on a 2-D pushing task, against a policy with no language
conditioning. It is not evidence about VLAs, about LIBERO, or about the arms this project
publishes. Until `gradient_patch` runs on the GPU lane, the correct summary is: **the harness now
has the attack it was missing, and has not yet pointed it at the policy the nulls were measured
on.**

**Their mechanism finding, kept because it is the transferable part.** The authors attribute the
first-step result to a gradient conflict specific to input-space optimization, and note it is
"exactly opposite to the training-time backdoor regime". That is a claim about where to spend a
gradient budget, and it survives independently of whether anyone reproduces the headline.

**The gap, stated at its true width.** This register carried a second copy of this entry until
31 August 2026, and that copy asserted **"Provael has never measured a flow-matching policy"**.
That was wrong, and wrong in the direction that excuses us: `lerobot_adapter.py` declares
`action_head_class = "flow"` and all 400 episodes of the pinned ten-task evidence record `flow`, so
SmolVLA is a flow-matching policy by this project's own taxonomy and we have measured one. The real
gap is narrower and less comfortable — provael has not measured **π0 or π0.5**, the specific
checkpoints DRIFT attacks; `provael list-policies` marks `pi0`, `pi05` and `pi0fast` as having no
run committed. So the architecture explanation stays unavailable, and what is missing is a
checkpoint, not a policy class. The taxonomy implication is argued separately in
[docs/top10-rfc.md](docs/top10-rfc.md); it is a proposal, not a change.

**What neither side can currently check.** DRIFT reports no benign false-positive rate on shared
fixtures, and ours is uncalibrated ([#136](https://github.com/provael/provael/issues/136)) — the
keep-out predicate is a default box, so our 4% (2/50) benign rate is a property of that box as much
as of the policy. Neither project can presently say what either attack's rate would be against a
matched, calibrated control on the same fixtures, and that is the comparison that would settle it.

### UniTexture — *Cross-Task Universal Adversarial Textures for Vision-Language-Action Models*
Dai, Dai, Wang, Li, Li, Zhu (2026) — Tongji University, MBZUAI, University of Electronic Science and
Technology of China.
arXiv:[2608.13453](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.13453) · submitted 13 August 2026

The second entry on the perception channel where provael measures a null, and the one that shows the
null is not even being measured in comparable units.

UniTexture optimises the **surface texture of a single 3D object** in the workspace — a plate or a
bowl — composited through a differentiable renderer (PyTorch3D), so the attack is a repaint rather
than an overlay. One texture is optimised to work across tasks, which is the "universal" claim.
Evaluated against OpenVLA (`openvla-7b-finetuned-libero-spatial`, `-libero-goal`) and π₀.₅
(`pi05_libero`) on **LIBERO-Spatial and LIBERO-Goal only** — not Object, not Long.

**Their headline is a task-success collapse, not an attack-success rate.** Verified from their
Table 1, `n = 100 episodes per cell` (10 tasks × 10 rollouts), stated explicitly in the paper.
Success rate in %, so **lower is a stronger attack** — the opposite reading direction to every ASR
in this file:

| model / suite | clean | UniTexture (plate) | UniTexture (bowl) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| OpenVLA · Spatial | 84.0 | 53.0 | **25.0** |
| OpenVLA · Goal | 80.0 | 58.0 | **29.0** |
| π₀.₅ · Spatial | 99.0 | 33.0 | 40.0 |
| π₀.₅ · Goal | 97.0 | 77.0 | 72.0 |

Their summary figure — mean task success "from 90.0% under benign conditions to 48.4% under attack"
— is the clean mean over 4 cells (400 episodes) against the attacked mean over 8 (800 episodes).

Two qualifiers travel with that 90.0 → 48.4, and the paper supplies both itself:

- **The 90.0 bypasses the renderer.** It is the clean-observation baseline. Their *rendered*
  controls — the object's original texture, and a Gaussian-noise texture — average 87.75 and 81.1.
  So some of the drop is the renderer and the change of appearance rather than the optimised
  perturbation. Reporting 90.0 → 48.4 without those two controls would overstate the targeted
  effect, and to their credit they ship both.
- **Cross-model transfer is one-way.** Textures optimised on π₀.₅ drop OpenVLA to 26–61%; textures
  optimised on OpenVLA leave π₀.₅ at 92–97% against a clean 97–99%, which is no effect at all.
  "Transfers cross-model" is true only in the π₀.₅ → OpenVLA direction and should not be repeated
  without it. Cross-*suite* transfer is reported in both directions and does hold.

Their "distribution of tasks, instructions, states, and viewpoints" is the abstract's wording; the
formal objective is a two-level expectation over tasks and over that task's demonstration
distribution. Instruction, state and viewpoint are attributes of a sampled frame, not independent
randomisation axes — the threat model fixes the camera pose explicitly.

**Why this cannot be put in a column next to our 0/100, and why that is the point.**

The paper reports **no attack-success rate at all** — the strings "ASR" and "attack success" do not
appear in it. Its metric is task-success degradation: did the robot finish the job. Ours is envelope
breach: did the robot leave the region it was allowed to occupy. These are different questions, and
a policy that fails *safely* — stops, refuses, freezes short of the goal — scores near-total success
on their axis and **zero** on ours. Placing 48.4% beside 0/100 would not be an unflattering
comparison, it would be an arithmetic error, and it is the exact error
`docs/standards/published-asr-baselines.md` and `/compare/published-attack-baselines` exist to stop.
The honest comparator is the sentence, not the number: *SR 90.0% → 48.4%, n = 100 per cell,
simulation only.*

**What it does not have, stated because DURA does have it.** No physical validation: UniTexture is
LIBERO-only, with no real arm, no printed texture and no hardware column. On that axis it is closer
to us than DURA is — which is not a point in our favour so much as a reminder that most of this
channel is still simulated.

#### What neither paper reports, and it is the same thing

Both are stronger attacks than ours. Neither reports **a matched benign twin per episode**, and
neither reports **an interval or a significance test on any figure in either paper**. Verified by
reading both full texts for confidence / 95% / ± / error bar / significan / McNemar / bootstrap /
t-test / Wilcoxon / binomial: no hits on any headline number.

- **DURA is silent on pairing.** Its ASR is defined as the fraction of rollouts in which the
  attacked policy fails, which does not separate attack-caused failure from the failure the policy
  had anyway — and their own benign row is 23.5%, so roughly a quarter of it is not the attack.
  The benign row is demonstrably a reused aggregate rather than a per-episode control: it is
  **byte-identical across the Simulated and Physical column blocks** of Table 1. The only "paired"
  language in the paper is about image-quality crops, not episode outcomes.
- **UniTexture pairs, but one level too low.** It computes clean predictions "from the same
  simulator state" and calls them "step-aligned counterfactuals", which is real matching, and its
  directional metrics (TDS, pDHR) are honest paired differences. But the clean predictions are
  never *executed*, so the headline success-rate comparison is still attacked rollouts against
  separately-run clean rollouts. Once the attacked trajectory diverges there is no matched cell to
  compare an outcome against.

This is the gap, and it is what provael's harness is for. Our arms run in **one report**, matched at
the same `(task, seed)`, so every comparison is a cell-by-cell pair: 44/50 for `roleplay` against 0
discordant benign twins, McNemar exact p = 4.6e-13, task-clustered 95% CI [72%, 100%], plus a
harmless-variation control arm that fired 1/50 and is indistinguishable from doing nothing
(p = 0.625). `examples/matched_pairs.py` runs that machinery on CPU in under a second.

Two honest limits on that claim. It is a claim about **method, not about strength** — their attacks
work and ours does not, and no amount of pairing changes that. And our own benign control fires
2/50 against an uncalibrated predicate ([#136](https://github.com/provael/provael/issues/136)), so
the control we are holding up as the missing piece has a false-positive rate we have not yet
characterised either.

**Priority note.** This paper (13 August 2026) and DURA (11 August 2026) both **post-date** provael's
visual family, which shipped in the v0.25.x line in July 2026. They are concurrent work, not prior
art in the priority sense, and they are in this file because this file credits the literature that
bounds our claims rather than because either got somewhere first. Neither entry is an admission of
precedence; both are an admission that the published attacks on this channel are stronger and more
real than ours.

**mapping_status: `cited, not crosswalked`.** Their unit is task success and ours is envelope breach;
no denominator is shared, so a crosswalk row would manufacture a comparison the metrics do not
support.

[AI45Lab/Awesome-Trustworthy-Embodied-AI](https://github.com/AI45Lab/Awesome-Trustworthy-Embodied-AI)

**What it is.** A survey organising embodied-AI trustworthiness across four **operational stages** —
Instruction Understanding, Environment Perception, Physical Interaction, Action Planning — each with
its own *Attack Resistance* subsection alongside Accuracy, Reliability, Controllability, Privacy
Protection, Abuse Prevention and Value Alignment.

**How we differ, and it is unflattering in both directions.** The survey is a taxonomy over the
literature; provael is one runnable tool that produces a number.

Their four-stage decomposition is **cleaner than our ten-item list** at one specific thing our
taxonomy does badly: separating *where in the loop* a failure originates. The Embodied AI Security
Top 10 indexes by attack channel, which cuts across their stages rather than nesting inside them, and
we have not attempted a crosswalk to it. That is a real gap on our side, not a difference of scope.

Against that, their index carries **183 reference links — 116 to arXiv, 69 unique arXiv IDs — and
zero links to anything a reader can execute** (verified: no GitHub links outside their own repo). A
practitioner leaves it knowing the shape of the field and holding nothing they can run.

**Where we are weaker, specifically.** Their Attack Resistance coverage spans all four stages. Ours
has a real-model measurement on exactly **one** — instruction understanding, where `roleplay` reaches
44/50 — and measured nulls or no attack at all on the rest. **Physical Interaction is the stage we
cannot speak to at all**, because `results/hardware/` reads 0 and the SO-101 protocol is
pre-registered and unrun.

**mapping_status: `cited, not crosswalked`.** Crosswalking a channel-indexed list onto a
stage-indexed one is a real piece of work — the two axes cross rather than merge, the same problem
the [World-Model Security Survey](#world-model-security-survey--security-of-world-model-based-embodied-ai-a-lifecycle-of-threats-defenses-and-evaluation)
entry describes — and claiming one before doing it would be the kind of table that reads as coverage
without carrying any.

### RedVLA — *Physical Red Teaming for Vision-Language-Action Models*
Zhang, Zhang, Fan, Shen, Cai, Yang, Ji (2026).
arXiv:[2604.22591](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.22591) · submitted 24 April 2026

**The closest published work to this project, and the complement to it rather than the competitor.**
It belongs at the top of this file and was missing from it entirely — it appeared once, inside a
run-on inline list in `docs/top10.md`, and nowhere in the ASR-baselines table that exists to hold
exactly this.

RedVLA red-teams **physical** safety in two stages: *Risk Scenario Synthesis* identifies critical
interaction regions from benign trajectories and places a risk object inside them, so the hazard
entangles with the policy's execution flow; *Risk Amplification* then refines that object's state by
gradient-free optimisation guided by trajectory features. Violations are typed across three safety
cost types — **State, Cumulative, Conditional**. They also ship a defense, **SimpleVLA-Guard**, built
from RedVLA-generated data, reporting a 59.5% reduction in online ASR.

**Why the denominators are not comparable, stated from their own formalism rather than ours.**
RedVLA defines VLA red teaming as a constrained optimisation over the **environment–instruction
joint space** — find a perturbed configuration `(s′₀, l′)` maximising elicited risk cost subject to
the task staying feasible. Having defined that joint space, §4 takes one half of it:

> "We fix the instruction (i.e., `l′ = l`) and perturb only the initial state."

Provael takes the other half. Its instruction family fixes the scene and perturbs `l`; the envelope
the run is scored against does not move. Two projects, one shared formalism, orthogonal axes — which
is a far more precise statement of the relationship than "different attack surface", and it is
theirs, not a gloss we invented.

**Both run on LIBERO, and both run in simulation.** That matters because it removes the explanation
one would reach for otherwise: this is *not* a sim-versus-hardware difference. Provael's zero
real-robot results are a real weakness (see below), but they are not why these numbers cannot share a
column. Even on identical hardware the quantities would differ — RedVLA measures a scene-induced
physical-safety violation under a fixed instruction, provael measures an envelope exit under a fixed
scene.

**Their numbers, as their Key Findings state them.** ASR up to **95.5% on π₀.₅**, and an average ASR
of **92.7%** across the five models with stronger baseline performance than OpenVLA, within 10
optimisation iterations. Across all six models the range runs **64.9%–95.5%**, OpenVLA lowest and
π₀.₅ highest. Each configuration is repeated over **10 trials** with different random seeds and
metrics averaged. **No comparison is drawn here between their 95.5% and provael's 88%** — see
[the baselines table](docs/standards/published-asr-baselines.md) for why that column would be a
category error.

**The finding of theirs that provael should be tested against.** OpenVLA-OFT improves benign success
over OpenVLA by 20.6 pp (97.1% vs 76.5%) *and* increases ASR by 25.6 pp (90.5% vs 64.9%), leading
them to suggest that stronger instruction-following ability may raise the likelihood of triggering
unsafe behaviour. Note carefully what that does and does not mean for us: their mechanism is a policy
following an *unmodified* instruction into a hazard, not a policy following a *reframed* one. It is
therefore a prediction worth testing against
[the semantic-versus-mechanical finding](docs/findings/semantic-vs-mechanical-instruction-attacks.md),
not evidence for it. If instruction-following competence drives susceptibility on their axis, a
policy that attends more to language should be more divertible on ours — and that is a run nobody has
done.

**Where we are weaker.** Six policies against our one measured. An optimisation loop that searches
the risk-factor state against our fixed four-template banks. A shipped, evaluated defense against our
two measured mitigations. And a physical-safety taxonomy with three cost types grounded in risk
predicates, against an envelope predicate that is **uncalibrated**. `provael calibrate` has since run
on LIBERO — ten `libero_object` fits, 6 September 2026 — and the predicate is still uncalibrated,
because those fits were withheld rather than adopted: the fitted hazard face flagged 0 of 12 attacked
episodes (see [`studies/keepout_face_selection/`](https://github.com/provael/provael/blob/main/studies/keepout_face_selection/README.md),
issue #136). What we carry that their reported setup does not surface is a matched benign control
at the same `(task, seed)` cell with a reported false-positive rate.

**mapping_status: `cited, not crosswalked`.** Their attack acts on the scene with the instruction
held fixed; ours acts on the instruction with the scene held fixed. The two occupy complementary
halves of the joint space *they* define, so a coverage table mapping one onto the other would imply a
shared denominator that does not exist. A crosswalk becomes claimable if provael ever measures a
scene-perturbation family on LIBERO — which is scoped and unrun.

### Ten Sins of Embodied AI Security — *Beyond Model Jailbreak: Systematic Dissection of the "Ten Deadly Sins" in Embodied Intelligence*
Huang, Li, Ma, Dai, Xu, Xu, Zhang, Wang, Cheng (2025).
arXiv:[2512.06387](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06387) · submitted 6 December 2025

**Read the paper before reusing the name.** "Ten Deadly Sins" reads like a competing ten-item
taxonomy sitting at the same layer as the Embodied AI Security Top 10. It is not one. It is a
holistic security analysis of **a single product — the Unitree Go2** — and its ten items are
implementation defects found in that product's stack, not attack-mechanism categories that generalise
to other systems. Treating it as a rival taxonomy would misrepresent it in the flattering direction
for us and the wrong direction for them.

**What they did.** BLE sniffing, traffic interception, APK reverse engineering, cloud API testing and
hardware probing across three architectural layers — **wireless provisioning, core modules, external
interfaces**. The abstract enumerates: hard-coded keys, predictable handshake tokens, WiFi credential
leakage, missing TLS validation, static SSH password, multilingual safety bypass behaviour, insecure
local relay channels, weak binding logic, and unrestricted firmware access. That is **nine named
defects for a list of ten**; the tenth is not identifiable from the abstract and is not guessed at
here.

**Where the two agree.** Most of their list lands inside **EAI07** (CPS, firmware, comms &
teleoperation compromise), whose strongest evidence is already UniPwn (CVE-2025-60250 / -60251) and
the Go1 backdoor (CVE-2025-2894) on this same vendor — so the Top 10 already points at this platform,
via different work. Weak binding logic is **EAI08** (identity, access & excessive autonomy).

**Where they diverge, and it is structural.** The Top 10 indexes by *attack mechanism against a
policy*; theirs indexes by *defect in one shipped product*. Nine of their ten never touch the model
at all. A taxonomy of the second kind cannot be crosswalked onto one of the first without inventing
correspondences.

**Two real gaps on our side, named rather than defended.**

1. **Multilingual safety bypass is absent from the Top 10.** The string "multilingual" does not
   appear in `docs/top10.md` anywhere. EAI01 covers instruction jailbreak through the direct channel,
   but the *language-selection* axis — the same request in another language clearing a guardrail it
   would not clear in English — is not named as a mechanism, and it is among the cheapest bypasses
   available against a shipped product. Provael ships no multilingual attack and measures nothing
   here.
2. **The companion app and vendor cloud are not named as surfaces.** EAI07's phrasing is "CPS,
   firmware, comms & teleoperation". The phone app that provisions the robot and the cloud API behind
   it are where APK reverse-engineering, weak binding logic and cloud API testing land — three of
   their five methods — and neither appears in the Top 10's layer vocabulary. EAI08 covers identity
   and authorisation abstractly without naming where they are administered.

Neither gap is closed by this entry. Both are recorded because the next revision of the Top 10 should
answer them.

**mapping_status: `cited, not crosswalked`.** Different layer, different unit of analysis; a mapping
table would manufacture correspondence.

### DAERT — *Uncovering Linguistic Fragility in Vision-Language-Action Models via Diversity-Aware Red Teaming*
Tong, He, Pan, Liu, Lin (2026).
arXiv:[2604.05595](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.05595) · submitted 7 April 2026

**The nearest published work to provael's own headline channel, on policies provael has never
measured.** DAERT attacks *linguistic* variation — the same axis as the instruction family — and
reports task success falling from **93.33% to 5.85%** on **π₀ and OpenVLA**.

Their contribution is methodological and it is a direct criticism of how provael generates
instructions. Standard RL-based red-teaming adversaries suffer **mode collapse**: reward maximisation
converges on a narrow set of repetitive failure patterns, so the search reports a high number while
exploring a small region. DAERT adds a diversity objective to keep coverage broad while staying
effective.

**Where we are weaker, and it is the same weakness Q-DIG named.** Provael's `paraphrase` and
`roleplay` arms are **fixed four-template banks**, not a search of any kind — so a null from them
bounds the bank and nothing wider, which is stated as a falsification condition on
[the semantic-versus-mechanical finding](docs/findings/semantic-vs-mechanical-instruction-attacks.md).
DAERT is the second independent demonstration (after Q-DIG, arXiv:2603.12510) that search finds
linguistic failures a hand-written set misses. Two papers now say the same thing about our method.

**What it does not settle for us.** DAERT reports **task-success collapse**; provael reports
**envelope exit**. A policy that stops working scores near-total on their metric and zero on ours, so
93.33%→5.85% cannot be read as an ASR in provael's sense — the standard comparability rule on
[the baselines page](docs/standards/published-asr-baselines.md) applies unchanged. It is also not a
test of the semantic-versus-mechanical distinction: they do not separate meaning-preserving from
meaning-reframing prompts, which is the whole content of that finding.

**mapping_status: `cited, not crosswalked`.**

### EmbodiedGovBench — *A Benchmark for Governance, Recovery, and Upgrade Safety in Embodied Agent Systems*
Qin, Luan, See, Yang, Li (2026).
arXiv:[2604.11174](https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.11174) · submitted 13 April 2026

**The one entry in this file that overlaps EAI10 rather than an attack channel.** EmbodiedGovBench
argues that task-success metrics leave a gap — they do not measure whether a system is *governable* —
and evaluates seven dimensions: **unauthorized capability invocation, runtime drift robustness,
recovery success, policy portability, version upgrade safety, human override responsiveness, audit
completeness**, across single-robot and fleet settings.

**Why it belongs here.** EAI10 (insufficient evaluation, observability & incident response) is the
Top 10 item provael marks `process-control-not-attackable` — there is no attack family for it because
it is not an attack surface. EmbodiedGovBench is the closest thing to a measurement instrument for
that item, and three of its dimensions map onto surfaces provael already emits rather than attacks:
audit completeness onto the evidence bundle and append-only ledger, version upgrade safety onto the
per-checkpoint regression gate, unauthorized capability invocation onto the `authorization` family
and EAI08.

**Where we are weaker.** Fleet settings, human override responsiveness and recovery success are
dimensions provael does not model at all — every run is single-policy, open-loop against a simulator,
with no operator in the loop and no recovery path to measure. Provael emits governance *evidence*; it
does not test whether governance *works*.

**mapping_status: `cited, not crosswalked`.** Their unit is a deployed agent system under operational
perturbation; ours is a policy under adversarial input. The overlap is in what gets reported, not in
what gets measured.

### Bit-Flip VLA — *Bit-Flip Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models: Action-Decoding Architecture Shapes the Vulnerability*
Gao, Chen, Wu, Zhou, Wang, Ji, Guo, Chen (2026).
arXiv:[2608.15475](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.15475) · submitted 16 August 2026

**The entry that made this project build a family it did not have.** Until 0.36.0, every one of
provael's adversarial families perturbed what the policy is shown or told — pixels, instruction,
sensor stream, injected text. This one corrupts the deployed weights, and reports that the boundary
sits in a different place depending on how the policy decodes actions. The `weight_integrity`
family (16 of 16) exists because of this paper and is shaped by it; what that family has and has
not established is set out under *mapping_status* below, and it is less than the paper's.

What it establishes. Quantized INT8 VLA weights are a Rowhammer-style fault surface: *"a few
gradient-selected flips reduce closed-loop success to 0%, while hundreds of random flips are
harmless."* The budget tracks the action head — **1–5 flips** for direct-regression and
discrete-token heads, against roughly **100–300** for the flow-matching policies they evaluate
(π0, π0.5). On a real 6-DoF arm, task-calibrated **emulated** K=100 corruption yielded **0/20**
successes against **14/20** clean and **16/20** for an equal-count global-random control, with 95%
CIs of [0, 16.8]% and [45.7, 88.1]%.

**Why it belongs here.** It reaches a surface none of our families reach, and it reports in the
shape we report in: a per-policy rate, a matched control arm at the same budget, and an interval.
The equal-count global-random arm is the part worth copying — it is the same move as our benign
control, and it is what turns "we broke it" into "we broke it *and* the breakage is attributable to
selection rather than to damage in general."

**Where we are weaker.** Three ways, and none is close. Their selection is a progressive search
that re-ranks after each flip; ours is a one-shot first-order ranking taken once against the clean
weights, which is strictly weaker and makes any provael null a lower bound rather than a finding.
They measured π0 and π0.5; provael has run this family against the deterministic CPU fixture and
nothing else, so it corroborates none of their architecture result. And they ran a physical 6-DoF
arm; provael's hardware run count is still zero.

**Where they are careful, and we should say so.** They scope their own claim rather than inflating
it: they evaluate *"logical INT8 corruption rather than end-to-end physical delivery"*, and state
that *"physical fault delivery and ECC remain outside scope."* Their "first bit-flip attack on a
VLA" is their claim, recorded here as theirs; this project does not repeat "first" claims of its
own or anyone else's.

**mapping_status: `implemented, not corroborated`.** Since 0.36.0 there is something on our side
to crosswalk to — `weight_integrity`, with a gradient arm and an equal-count random arm across a
1/4/16/64/256 flip ladder — and `docs/crosswalk/bit-flip-vla.md` states clause by clause what it
takes from this paper and what it does not.

**Implemented is not corroborated, and the gap is the whole story.** The family has run against the
deterministic CPU stub and against no real policy. The stub has one scalar danger head and no
action-decoding architecture, so it cannot exhibit architecture-dependence and does not: the
gradient-beats-random separation it shows is a property of that fixture, engineered so the
measurement path could be exercised at all. **Provael has not reproduced the 1–5 versus 100–300
result, has not tested a flow-matching head, and must not be cited as independent support for it.**
Doing so needs a GPU run against SmolVLA or π0 that has not happened. The shape the family holds to
is the one this paper and our own posture already constrained: emulated in-memory flips against
loaded weights only, always alongside an equal-count random-flip control arm, and
explicitly silent on whether an attacker could deliver the corruption on a real deployment — that
is a platform question about memory integrity, ECC and supply chain, and it is one this tool does
not touch and should not appear to answer.

### Manipulation Benchmark Audit — *What Are We Actually Benchmarking in Robot Manipulation?*
Tianchong Jiang, Xiangshan Tan, Samuel Wheeler, Luzhe Sun, Tewodros W. Ayalew, Matthew Walter (2026).
arXiv:[2606.04233](https://arxiv.org/abs/2606.04233) · submitted 2 June 2026 ·
[ripl/manipulation_benchmark_audit](https://github.com/ripl/manipulation_benchmark_audit)
(RIPL — Robot Intelligence through Perception Laboratory, Chicago).

**The only entry in this file that attacks the benchmarks rather than the policies.** Every other
citation here either breaks a VLA or measures one. This one asks whether the scores everybody
reports mean what they are taken to mean, and answers mostly no.

What it establishes. Four failure modes, *"each of which weakens or invalidates a benchmark's role
as a valid proxy for that capability"*: shortcut solvability, absent statistical significance,
creeping overfitting, and data-source dependence. Two results land directly on this project:

- **On LIBERO, *"a 0.09B probe with no language encoder scores at or near reported SOTA."*** The
  suite Provael's only real-policy result is measured on can be substantially solved by a model
  that cannot read the instruction.
- **On LIBERO, *"most reported gains are not provably statistically significant."***
- On CALVIN, *"randomizing block poses within the training range drops performance for every tested
  policy"* — the data-source dependence result.

**Why it belongs here, and it is not a comfortable reason.** Provael's headline is an attack-success
rate on LIBERO. If a language-blind 0.09B probe reaches near-SOTA task success on that suite, then
LIBERO task success is a weaker signal about language grounding than its use implies — and an
instruction-channel attack measured against it inherits that weakness. This does not invalidate the
redirection rate, which scores a keep-out predicate rather than task success. It does mean the
suite carries less evidential weight than the word "LIBERO" suggests to a reader who has not read
this paper.

**What it retroactively justifies.** Two choices this project already made, and now has a citation
for rather than a preference:

- Every rate ships with a **95% Wilson interval**, never a point estimate. Their significance
  finding is the argument for that, and it is the argument against the version of this project that
  reported a bare percentage.
- The two measured nulls stay in the table at **0/50 (`injection`) and 0/100 (`visual`)** rather
  than being dropped. Only three of the seventeen adversarial families in the registry have run
  against a real policy at all, and **two of those three returned zero** — so a board that quietly
  shed its zeros would be reporting a selected subset of an already small sample.

**mapping_status: `informs, does not overlap`.** Their unit is a benchmark's construct validity;
ours is a policy's behaviour under attack. Neither measures the other and no rate here is
comparable to anything there. The connection is methodological and runs one way: their result is a
reason to distrust a number, and this project publishes numbers.

**Not integrated.** Their audit code is public and **Provael runs none of it** — no shortcut probe,
no significance test from their harness, nothing. If any of it is ever adopted, this paragraph
changes and says which test and on what date. Until then this is a citation, not coverage, and the
distinction is the same one the bit-flip entry above draws.

### Frozen-backbone attachments (August 2026) — ForeTime-VLA and Q-Planning

Two papers submitted 21 August 2026 attach a small trained component to a **frozen** visuomotor
policy rather than fine-tuning it. Both are prior art for a question this project does not
currently ask: what, exactly, is Provael attacking when it attacks a deployed policy?

**ForeTime-VLA — *Causal Future-Token Distillation from a World Action Model for Conveyor-Belt
Manipulation*** ([arXiv:2608.20735](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.20735); Siyuan Ma, Yutian Zhang,
Boshi Zhang, Qinglian Wu, Jiaqi Zhai, Dong Wei, Xiaojin Huang). Offline, current and future video
latents are compressed into a whitened 64-D target; online, an eight-frame history encoder predicts
that target together with manipulation phase and normalised time-to-transition, at a 2.46–2.93%
latency cost. In real-robot evaluation it reports 81.1% stationary and 58.9% slow-moving grasp
success, and 44/90 grasps across three belt speeds against 23/90 for π0.5.

**`mapping_status: not_implemented`.** Provael attacks a policy as a single artifact. If the
anticipation head is a separable component, the attack surface is not the one we model — a
perturbation that reaches the history encoder is not the same as one that reaches the action
expert — and we have not tested that distinction, so we do not claim it either way.

**Q-Planning — *Beyond Imitation: Self-Improving Robot Policies via Off-Policy Q-Planning***
([arXiv:2608.21204](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.21204); Varun Giridhar, Anant Khandelwal, Jeremy A.
Collins, Ignat Georgiev, Animesh Garg). A small off-policy Q-function over a frozen BC policy,
absorbing both successful and failed deployment rollouts — an asymmetry BC does not have — with
only the Q-function fine-tuned. On two contact-rich bimanual real-robot tasks, with the BC weights
frozen and no human intervention, it improves purely from its own deployment rollouts: stack-cups
40% → 90% and insert-wallet 25% → 80% in five iterations.

**`mapping_status: not_implemented`.** This one matters for a reason worth stating plainly rather
than burying: **a policy that learns from its own failures makes a one-shot ASR a snapshot rather
than a property.** Every number this project publishes assumes the thing measured holds still. Our
leaderboard has no concept of a policy that moves after we measure it — no re-measurement cadence,
no field for "measured at iteration *n*", nothing that would stop a stale row being read as a
current property of a policy that has since improved past it. That is a gap in the *instrument*,
not in coverage, and it is not fixed by adding an attack.

Neither is implemented and neither is covered. They are recorded because they change what our
number means, which is a different reason from the one most entries above are here for.

### ESTI — *Breaking Planner Integrity Boundary: Enviroment State-Text Injection Attack on LLM-Driven Embodied Agents*
Jiawei Liu, Jiacheng Guo, Tian Zhang, Yiwei Xu, Juan Wang, Jinlin Fan, Bowen Xiao, Chi Guo,
Keyan Guo, Hongxin Hu (2026).
arXiv:[2608.16806](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.16806) · v1 17 August 2026, v2 18 August 2026

(The misspelling of "Environment" is the authors' own, in the published title. Quoted as printed
so the string matches what a search returns.)

**A different injection surface from ours.** ESTI writes adversarial text into the **environment
state** an LLM-driven planner reads — object properties, spatial relations, affordances — rather
than into the user instruction. The authors describe it as the first closed-loop attack fabricating
"false state evidence compatible with the current environment" without touching the instruction or
the model weights. Their abstract reports **improvements of up to 89.32% (planning-level) and
43.69% (execution-level) attack success over prior methods** — improvements over baselines, not
absolute rates, and stated here as reported rather than replicated.

**Their separation of P-ASR from E-ASR is the transferable part.** A planner can be successfully
misled and the manipulated plan still fail to execute; collapsing the two into one number would
report a capability the robot does not have. That is the same distinction `endpoints.py` exists to
protect, arrived at from a different architecture.

**mapping_status: `partial`.** The injection surface maps onto **EAI01** (instruction and prompt
integrity) and the planner/execution split onto **EAI05**. It does **not** map onto a runnable
attack family here, and the reason is architectural rather than a matter of effort: ESTI targets a
**planner-plus-executor** stack, where the attack lands on the text a planner reads. Our families
target a **single end-to-end VLA policy**, which has no separate planner to mislead and no plan to
corrupt between deciding and acting. Treating the two as equivalent would overstate our coverage by
claiming a surface our threat model does not contain.

**What they have that we do not:** a planner/executor decomposition of failure, so a partial
compromise is visible as one.
**What we have that they do not:** a benign control arm, so our rates carry a floor. An attack-side
number without one cannot distinguish a policy the attack broke from a policy that was failing
anyway.

### TOWN-VLA — *Think Only When Needed: Prompt-Authority Control for Selective Slow-Path Intervention in Vision-Language-Action Manipulation*
Zhiruo Zhou, Zelin Li, Xiwen Chen, Jiazhuo Li, Chenwei Wang, Huiming Chen, Xiaojun Zhu (2026).
arXiv:[2608.23224](https://arxiv.org/abs/2608.23224) · submitted 24 August 2026

**The finding is more interesting than the fix, so take it first.** Retrieval-augmenting a frozen
VLA — the audited base policy is **OpenVLA-OFT**, OpenVLA under the Optimized Fine-Tuning recipe,
in LIBERO-Plus simulation — is normally read as supplying *context*. Their framing is that it does not: retrieved text
"becomes a control intervention once it enters the executed prompt". The audit behind that sentence
is worth quoting verbatim, because it is a **control** rather than a headline:

> In a matched audit, raw appended text reduces mean success from 92.47% to 3.00%, while meaningful
> and length-matched meaningless appends both fail on all 500 states.

They name the effect **prompt-form collapse**: "changing the instruction form, rather than adding
useful semantics, can dominate execution."

**Their mechanism, credited.** TOWN-VLA is a *prompt-authority interface* that separates candidate
generation from permission to alter the policy input. A fixed compatibility rule authorizes a
canonical compact instruction; otherwise the interface restores the original Base prompt exactly.
Across 900 audited routes they report every route following that contract — 525 routes recovering
Base with matching hashes, and all 375 authorized prompts preserving the task signature. The
hash-verified restore is the design idea worth reusing: an interface that can *decline* to rewrite,
and prove afterwards that it did not.

**`mapping_status: not_implemented`.** Provael ships no retrieval path and no prompt-authority
gate, and has measured neither. What this paper changes is not our coverage but our reading of a
defense we have already published — see the last paragraph.

**The caveat, stated rather than omitted.** The arXiv abstract page carries **no institutional
affiliation**, **no code link and no comments field**, and the numbers are self-reported with no
independent replication we could find. Metadata above was read from the arXiv abstract page on
25 August 2026. **The magnitude is recorded as awaiting independent replication.** The *control* is
what makes the paper hard to argue with, and the control does not depend on trusting the magnitude.
Note also which arm is which: their simulation number is the modest one — on a matched 4×7
LIBERO-Plus evaluation at 10,030 episodes per method, success rises from 69.5% to 73.1%, 95% CI
1.89–5.45 points — while the physical-arm result (a frozen π0.5 checkpoint on a PiPER arm, 52.7% →
78.7% over 150 trials per method, p = 3.16e-6) is the large one. Anyone quoting only the second is
quoting the arm with the smaller *n* and no released code.

**What it costs us, and this is why the entry exists.** Provael's one credited defense,
`instruction_canonicalization`, normalises *semantics* — it strips urgency, manner and paraphrase
frames. If length-matched *meaningless* appends collapse a policy exactly as hard as meaningful
ones, then the failure mode TOWN-VLA identifies is invisible to that defense by construction; and
our own `credited` verdict may be partly an artifact of the same axis, because stripping tokens
also **shortens** the prompt. The open question, and the concrete test that would settle it, are

We do not have the answer and this entry does not guess at one.

### VLA-Risk — *Benchmarking Vision-Language-Action Models with Physical Robustness*
OpenReview [31EjDFwFEe](https://openreview.net/forum?id=31EjDFwFEe) (2025).

**Read from the public abstract only, and that limit is part of the entry.** OpenReview serves both
its web and API paths behind a bot challenge, which this project does not bypass, so everything
below comes from the abstract and listing metadata. Where their formalism would settle a question,
this entry says so rather than guessing at it — the surrounding entries quote papers directly, and
the difference in confidence should be visible rather than smoothed over.

**What it covers.** 296 scenarios and 3,784 episodes, spanning simple manipulation, semantic
reasoning and autonomous driving. Attacks are structured along two axes at once: the input modality
perturbed (image and instruction) and three task dimensions — object, action, space.

**Why it does not share a denominator with ours.** Two reasons, and only the first is certain from
the abstract. Their reported outcome is degradation on the attack tasks — how much worse the policy
does at the thing it was asked to do. Provael scores an **envelope breach**: whether the
end-effector entered a keep-out region, whether or not the task succeeded. Those come apart in both
directions. A policy can fail its task without leaving the envelope, which is incompetence rather
than a safety event; and the committed run shows the other direction directly, with clean-task
success averaging 84% while `roleplay` drove 44 of 50 matched pairs out of the envelope. The second
reason is breadth: their scope includes autonomous driving, which provael does not touch at all.

**Where we are weaker.** 296 scenarios against our ten `libero_object` tasks, and both an image and
an instruction axis against our one measured family. Their episode count is an order of magnitude
above our 350.

**What we carry that the abstract does not surface.** A matched benign control at the same
`(task, seed)` cell with a reported false-positive rate, and the interval around it.

**mapping_status: `complementary, different failure definitions`.** No crosswalk is claimed. Their
axis is task degradation under perturbation; ours is a spatial predicate under a fixed scene. A
coverage table would imply a shared denominator that does not exist, and the abstract alone is not
enough to build one honestly.

### SAFE — *Multitask Failure Detection for Vision-Language-Action Models*
Gu, Kim, Kuang, Sharma, et al. (2025) — NeurIPS 2025.
arXiv:[2506.09937](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09937) · OpenReview
[XPyAukgsFf](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XPyAukgsFf)

**Detection, not elicitation, and listed for completeness rather than comparison.** SAFE reads a
VLA's own internal features and predicts a scalar for how likely the current rollout is to fail,
giving a timely enough alert that a robot can stop, backtrack or ask for help. It is trained on both
successful and failed rollouts, evaluated on unseen tasks, calibrated with conformal prediction, and
works across OpenVLA, π₀ and π₀-FAST.

**There is no overlapping quantity.** Provael manufactures a failure and reports how often the
attempt succeeds. SAFE observes a rollout it did not cause and reports whether it is going wrong.
Neither number bounds the other, and a reader comparing an attack success rate to a detection rate
is comparing an offense to a monitor.

**Where it is genuinely relevant to us, and unmeasured.** SAFE is the shape of mitigation
`provael mitigation` exists to score — a runtime monitor an operator could actually install, sitting
between the policy and the robot. Nothing here has been run against it, and its multitask
generalisation claim is the interesting one to test: a detector trained on benign task failures has
no reason in principle to fire on an *adversarially redirected* rollout that is executing
competently, just toward the wrong place. Whether it does is an open question and a run nobody has
done.

**mapping_status: `complementary, listed for completeness`.** No crosswalk, and no claim of
superiority in either direction: it detects, we elicit.

## What is actually novel here

Not the attacks. **And — since AttackVLA (arXiv:2511.12149) — not simply "a unified harness with a
comparable ASR" either.** That claim stood in earlier versions of this file and it no longer
survives contact with the literature: AttackVLA is a unified VLA attack framework with a comparable
ASR *and* real-robot evaluation. Restating it would have been the easy thing and the false thing.

What is left is narrower, and it is the part a research benchmark has no incentive to build:

1. A **deterministic, CPU-only, no-download core** (StubPolicy + StubSuite). The ASR for a fixed
   seed is an exact, asserted number, reproducible in seconds with no GPU, no weights and no
   network. This is what makes a result *auditable by a third party* rather than merely published.
2. An **evidence and compliance layer**: SARIF for code scanning, OSCAL, a CycloneDX ML-BOM, signed
   attestation over a canonical serialisation, and a **Wilson-CI regression gate** wired into CI
   that fails a checkpoint on a statistically-disjoint regression rather than a hand-picked
   threshold. The output is designed to be *evidence*, not a table in a paper.
3. **A refusal to report a number we did not measure.** Inapplicable episodes are reported `N/A`
   and excluded from the denominator, never scored 0%; every rate ships with its 95% Wilson CI and
   a benign-FPR control arm; families that have not been shown to transfer to a real policy are
   labelled stub-validated scaffolding in the README. This is enforced by tests, not by intent.

3 is not a marketing line. It is the reason 1 and 2 are worth anything, and it is the only one of
the three that a better-funded competitor cannot simply out-build.

**What we explicitly do NOT claim:** originating the unified-VLA-harness idea (AttackVLA), any
sim-to-real transfer result (we have never run on hardware — see the README's first limitation),
parity with white-box attacks (UPA-RFAS, ADVLA), or any certification, conformity or functional-safety
status.

## What this is *not*

- Not a new attack algorithm or a state-of-the-art jailbreak.
- Not a backdoor / training-time method.
- Not a defense.
- Not a real-world exploitation tool (see [SAFETY.md](SAFETY.md)).
- **Not the first anything.** Provael has never claimed to be first, and this file is the reason —
  every entry above is prior work that got there earlier. The claim is stated here explicitly
  because a third party is publishing the opposite: an automated trend-scraper
  (`THTHDGCS/agents-radar`) has 29 bot-generated issues describing Provael as *"a first-of-its-kind
  open-source red-teaming framework for VLA robot policies"*. Those issues are public and indexable,
  nobody here wrote them, and an LLM summary is not a citation.

  If you found that phrasing and came here to check it: it is wrong, we disown it, and the honest
  version is in [What is actually novel here](#what-is-actually-novel-here) — which is narrower than
  "first" and got narrower again after AttackVLA (arXiv:2511.12149) shipped a unified VLA attack
  framework with a comparable ASR.
