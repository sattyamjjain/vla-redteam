"""Provael ASR leaderboard — Hugging Face Space (Gradio).

Renders the committed ``results/*.json`` (from ``provael leaderboard build``) as a ranked table
with a RoboArena-style **all-policies vs. open-source-policies** split, example attacked payloads,
and an **open-submission** tab that opens a PR to a requests dataset for review
(Open-LLM-Leaderboard pattern). No GPU is used to *view*; submissions are validated offline by a
maintainer before promotion.

Both the Hub client and ZeroGPU are imported lazily/guarded so this app also runs locally with
``python app.py`` (submission is disabled without ``HF_TOKEN``).

#: The requests dataset a submission opens a PR against (Open-LLM-Leaderboard pattern).
#:
#: This used to point at `provael-submissions/requests`, an ORG THAT WAS NEVER CREATED — verified
#: 2026-08-08: org page 404, datasets API 401, `?author=provael-submissions` returns `[]`. The
#: submit button had been aimed at nothing since it shipped.
#:
#: It now points under the same account that owns the Space, so the token the Space already needs
#: covers it and there is no org to administer. A separate org is the Open-LLM-Leaderboard shape and
#: is worth revisiting if submissions ever reach a volume that justifies it; at zero third-party
#: submissions in the leaderboard's lifetime, an org was infrastructure standing between a stranger
#: and a contribution.
#:
#: It still may not exist — `scripts/setup_requests_dataset.py` creates it — and the code below
#: treats that as a state to report rather than a crash. See GUARANTEED_ROUTE.
REQUESTS_REPO = "Sattyam/provael-leaderboard-requests"

#: Where a submitter is sent when the queue is unavailable. A GitHub issue on the product repo needs
#: no HF org, no token and no dataset to exist — it is the route that cannot break. Same discipline
#: as the website's lead-sink chain: never report a capture that did not happen, and always leave a
#: working path rather than an apology.
GUARANTEED_ROUTE = "https://github.com/provael/provael/issues/new"

#: Adversarial families in the `provael` registry (excluding the benign `baseline` control) — the
#: denominator of the coverage line below.
#:
#: Hardcoded because this Space deliberately installs **no** `provael` (see requirements.txt:
#: viewing renders committed JSON and needs no package), so it cannot import the registry to count
#: them. A hardcoded count is a claim, and claims here drift: the repo shipped a release with three
#: documents still saying "fourteen" after this number became 15. `tests/test_counted_claims.py`
#: therefore checks this constant against the live registry and fails the build if they disagree.
TOTAL_ADVERSARIAL_FAMILIES = 17

#: The release this Space was published from — the "you are here" against which `measured_with`
#: reads as stale. Checked against `provael.__version__` by `tests/test_counted_claims.py` for the
#: same reason as above: an unguarded version string in an uninstalled Space rots invisibly.
